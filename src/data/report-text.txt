The University of the West Indies, Mona Campus’ performance during the 2018/2019 academic year was built on the foundations laid for realizing the goals of the 2017-2022 Triple A Strategic Plan. The success of the Plan rests on enabling increased Access to our educational programmes; greater Alignment and partnerships which would be beneficial to the region; and nimble Agility in responding to an ever-changing environment.

As a tertiary institution of choice, we have made strides regarding the pillar of Access, in affording tertiary educational opportunities to a broad majority. Approximately 74% of undergraduates are firstgeneration university students. These students, armed with an education, have the power to change the trajectory of their families’ circumstances and to make a valuable contribution to nation-building. The returns of a good education are well-documented and include higher employment rates and compensation. It is important that The UWI continues to invest in young people. The stories of UWI students excelling in their fields are encouraging and inspiring and reflect the importance of mutuality. If we believe in and support others, they will perform to their utmost abilities.

Pro Vice-Chancellor and Campus Principal Professor Webber has provided sound leadership during the period as he seeks to expand the reach of The UWI in Western Jamaica, through online offerings and strategic partnerships. The financial reports submitted to the annual Campus Council meeting reflect the activities of the Mona Campus and also highlights the fact that greater effort will be needed to achieve financial sustainability.

There were some changes in administration during the year, including the appointment of Dr Donovan Stanberry as the new Campus Registrar. Outgoing Registrar, Dr Camille Bell-Hutchinson, provided outstanding leadership in this capacity to The University, and we commend her for her sterling contribution. I would also like to use this opportunity to welcome The University’s new Registrar, Dr Maurice Smith and extend our congratulations on his appointment in this role as the main administrator of the affairs of our regional university.

Like many organizations which are faced with uncertainty, The University has not acceded to the challenges it faces, but is committed to being a University for all of its constituents. With people at the heart of our quest for development status at the Mona Campus, let us continue to maximize resources, particularly the human resources, for a sustainable future.

Hon. Earl Jarrett, OJ, CD, JP, CStJ, Hon. LL.D, Hon. Ed.D, Hon. D. Univ, FCA  Chairman  The UWI, Mona Campus Council

I am proud and pleased to present this Report, which reflects my first year in office as Pro Vice-Chancellor and Principal of the Mona Campus.

It has been a challenging year, but not without its successes. I am grateful for the support of the Campus staff from all departments and at all levels. The most important resource that the Campus possesses is that of its human capital and the successes we have achieved this year would not have been possible without their collective contributions. The support and guidance of the Senior Management team has been invaluable. The unwavering support of the team in the Office of the Principal has allowed us to successfully launch the new website of the Office of the Principal which gives insight into the organogram, functions and projects of this Office. 

On taking up the position of Campus Principal, one of my main objectives was to sensitize and inform all Campus stakeholders to The UWI Triple ‘A’ Strategy including Vision, Mission and Core Values through in-house presentations, town hall meetings, orientation sessions and senior management meetings. 

At our September staff retreat, each of the Units in the Office of the Principal came away with a better understanding of the three Strategic pillars and as the Office was charged with aligning the Campus around these goals, visual reinforcements to embed and bring awareness to The UWI’s strategy were placed at focal points in the Office. While The UWI Triple ‘A’ Strategy and its three-pronged pillars had been repeatedly communicated in various fora from the rolling out of the 2017-2022 Strategic Plan, it seemed to me that our departments and divisions, whether teaching, research, administrative or service oriented, needed to appreciate how they were each contributing to the pillars of Access, Alignment and Agility, and more so, how their inputs incrementally added to the Campus delivery on these targets.

During the 2018/2019 academic year, the Senior Management team revisited the initiatives that we agreed to in the first year of the Strategic Plan. Taking into consideration the physical plant, ICT infrastructure and financial health of the Campus, a decision was made to focus on six high-level strategic priorities at the Campus level.

These were Digitization as a means of increasing access to a UWI education; Fostering a Culture of Research to improve publication output; Restoring Financial Health to bolster our economic base; Improving the quality of teaching, learning and student development; Establishing new academic/industry partnerships while nurturing our existing ones; and Initiating a caring, accountable and motivated professional (CAMP) team. As a new Principal on the block, I was especially moved to project the Mona Campus as a more caring community, with a customer service that was attentive and efficient in addressing the needs of our students, staff, the many stakeholders we currently serve and those we must attract and draw into our fold. The decision to focus on these six had the support of the Campus staff particularly, and at the end of 2018/2019 I can safely say, as this Report will also attest, that our determination to focus our energies on maximizing our best strengths and most available resources has borne results. We look forward to these solid foundational pillars moving the Campus along to further heights in the coming academic year.

The University of the West Indies made its debut in the prestigious Times Higher Education (THE) ranking of research universities from around the world. The UWI participated for the first time in 2018 and represented the only Caribbean institution on the ranked list. Placed 37of 129 Latin American universities and 591of 1,258 universities, The UWI stood out visibly in the midst of a Caribbean region that has over 200 registered universities. We scored well in the areas of citation impact, international co-authorship, international staff, and staff-student ratio. Having a sizeable student population from the Caribbean, The UWI, however, still needs to attract more students from outside the region to improve its score on international students. The THE ranking exercise has provided the Mona Campus administrators with a better understanding of where the University stands locally, regionally and internationally, and provides a global performance metric for measuring our institution’s progress under the current UWI Strategic Plan. The UWI Strategic Plan 2017-2022 underscores the need for The University of the West Indies campuses to jointly utilize their resources and capabilities in order to achieve maximum outcomes, both to ensure their long-term survival, and to support a revitalized Caribbean development.

The UWI Triple A Strategy provides a detailed and unifying guide for action, constantly reminding us of our vision and mission and the actions that are needed to reach our intended goals. The UWI’s vision is to be an excellent global university rooted in the Caribbean. This aspiration is supported by the Triple A pillars: Access, Alignment, and Agility that seek to increase access to a tertiary education, closer alignment with public and private sectors, and being agile in all we do to enhance our reputation and financial health.During the year 2018/2019, to ensure that on the Mona campus we were meeting our Triple A pillared goal, we provided an enabling environment that was channeled by six high-level priority strategies. These six strategies were geared to enhance infrastructural support and   motivationally stimulate our staff and current and potential stakeholders. The six overlapping priority strategies were: (1) Improving the quality of teaching, learning and student development, (2) Fostering a Culture of Research, (3) Establishing new academic/industry partnerships, (4) Restoring Financial Health, (5) Initiating a Caring, Accountable, Motivated Professional Team (CAMP), and (6) Digitization.

(1) Improving the quality of teaching, learning and student development is an underlying goal of the Mona Campus. Efforts are ongoing to improve the ability of staff to transfer knowledge, especially that of current research, and to support the curriculum and instruction in our classrooms. Through our Centre for Excellence and Learning (CETL) and the Health Professionals Education Unit (HPEU) staff are engaged and empowered in instruction delivery. The addition of the Campus Office for Online Learning (COOL) further supports this effort as the Campus moves towards online delivery as a major goal.

(2) Fostering a Culture of Research is central to our University as it is our reputation in research that separates The UWI from other tertiary institutions. This is our competitive advantage and the very core of who and what we are as a University. This year we have emphasized and reinforced this among our students, staff and partners through incentives and supports that allow for a continued thriving culture of research on the Mona Campus. This is evident in the research outputs of our students, departments and research centres. 

(3) Sustaining and establishing new academic/industry partnerships allow us to provide the research information and data required by industry partners to fuel national development. For the period under review our existing partnerships placed us at the heart of national and regional development, and symbolized our commitment to the belief that universities were not created for themselves but for the communities they serve.

(4) Restoring Financial Health was identified as a major priority and selected because of the lack of financial resources on the Campus. The Campus needed to get back to the 2012 point of self-sufficiency and to aim to sustain this for the future. The initiatives taken under this priority are distributed in relevant sections of this Report and will demonstrate that the Mona Campus has given precedence to areas that are being funded, while also ensuring academic freedoms to pursue innovative research and knowledge making. 

(5) Initiating a Caring, Accountable, Motivated Professional Team (CAMP) is a less palpable but essential ingredient of this year’s resource maximization approach. Staff need to feel valued to generate the desired level of productivity. By motivating staff through training, retreats, recognition and other incentives, we began improvements to create greater accessibility and agility of our services, thus advancing the financial health of the Campus. The Mona Campus continues to be strapped financially but its most valuable asset is that of its human resources: its faculty, its students and the network of administrative, technical and service staff who carry out the business of the Campus daily.

(6) We continue to view Digitization as a key to transformation of processes used both in administration and in the primary service we offer of teaching and communication of knowledge products. The process of moving to a fully digitized University began this year with selected first steps that will be accelerated in the next. These included assistance to Research and Teaching in the form of improved online processes and tools, improvements in our application processes, facilitating staff access to publications, enhancing citation indices for journals and the measurement of impact factors. There have been parallel digital transformation of the systems and processes in the Bursary in the fifth priority strategy of the Campus, CAMP, especially for improvement of our human resource processes. 

The 2018/2019 Report evaluates the Campus performance for this year through the initiatives and achievements of departments, faculties and individuals, with a selection of illustrative examples. The Triple A Strategic pillars Access, Agility and Alignment underpin the objectives to be met by these initiatives and provide the structure for this Report’s narrative. The successes and challenges are distributed in the various sections of this comprehensive Report and are analyzed under the following metrics.
$$

Repositioning who we are to meet the needs of society
$$
The Mona Campus has made consistent gains over the year to ensure that our brand as the premier tertiary institution for students, for research and knowledge outputs, for creative and innovative thinking about our societal and regional future, remains firmly rooted in the hearts and minds of our stakeholders.

The academic year 2018/2019 was an eventful one for The UWI, Mona. The Campus concluded its 70th Anniversary celebrations, commemorating 1948 when the College first opened its doors to 33 medical students from across the Caribbean. Seventy-one years later, the Campus boasts a population of over 19,000 students in over 300 programmes across seven (7) faculties.    

During the year under review, the Mona Campus made great strides in realizing the objective of being the University of choice. Our publication output in reputable journals showed consistent growth over the last four years.   

As developed in this Annual Report, the Mona Campus made some progress in widening access to a UWI education. We converted some face-to-face programmes for online delivery and hosted the Ground Breaking ceremony at Barnett Estates in Montego Bay for the planned expansion of the Western Jamaica Campus. The Mona Campus Research Days were one of our highpoints for the year. The exposition and events demonstrated the impressive spread and interdisciplinary nature of our research and the links that we are making between Campus research and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   
$$

Let us be your research engine
$$
We continued to forge partnerships with local, regional and international entities that have materialized in faculty and student exchanges, internships and employment opportunities for students, and research fellowships and funding for the institution. We further consolidated our ties with the National Commercial Bank (NCB) primarily through their ongoing linkages with the Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM). 

We strengthened our relationship with the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) with which we have ongoing ties and exchanges. Dr. Wayne Henry, Director General of the PIOJ confirmed this working agreement between the institutions when he spoke of The UWI’s contribution to the PIOJ and Vision 2030, drawing attention to fact that 32 UWI members sit on the Thematic Working Group of Vision 2030 that is driven by the PIOJ. The PIOJ contributed financially to The UWI Mona Research Days 2018/2019, ensuring that we had the support to make this event a major success.  

Of special note was the completion of the new Confucius Institute (CI) at the Mona Campus signaling a ten-year partnership between this Campus and the People’s Republic of China.  
$$

More proactive, more responsive
$$
Restoring financial health as a mark of our agility was one of our priorities in 2018/19. The year began with the appointment of a Financial Subcommittee of the Finance and General Purposes Committee (F&GPC), a Subcommittee comprised predominantly of external members of F&GPC, that was charged to review and make decisions on each financial decision that affects the Campus. The year 2018/2019 saw the formal establishment of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Unit to ensure intensive oversight and management over the financial, legal and technical relationships of this partnership. Three projects that are targeted to earn us the biggest financial gains are currently being monitored by the PPP Unit.   

The Mona Campus continues to play its part in ensuring that The UWI is the University of Choice through its international recognition in climate change and its alignment with sustainable and national development goals on climate change and the marine environment. With a focus on cost management, operational excellence and student centricity we are actively seeking to be more proactive by developing and testing new products and commercializing our services. We are confident that these efforts will continue to elevate our standing in The Times Higher Education World University Rankings.    

The 2017–2022 Strategic Plan calls for an articulated alignment between the academic research outputs and activity and industry requirements for Caribbean socioeconomic development in the twenty-first century. In addition, we have positioned ourselves as a Campus rooted in the Caribbean yet positioned to respond to global needs. In light of this, our centres of research, institutes and faculties have adopted a proactive stance to respond to the fundamental appeals of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, while simultaneously forging links with government and leading industry experts and organizations, the latter marking out our contribution to the Jamaica National Development Goals in Jamaica’s Vision 2030.   
$$

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
$$
The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 by UN member states are crucial to reducing inequality, ending poverty, arresting some of the deleterious effects of consumption on the planet, while stimulating economic growth and recovery and sustainability of both developed and developing countries. As drivers of scientific knowledge, innovation and research skills, universities are central actors in contributing to these Goals. Each of the 17 Goals cut across and through the academic disciplines that are advanced through teaching, research and innovation and public outreach. Contained in the theme of this Annual Report “towards a sustainable future” are the watchwords that speak directly to the SDGs. The Mona Campus undertakings this year have been processed with the 17 stated Goals in mind. While we have made contributions under all, we are especially proud of those that relate to Goals 13, 14 and 15, to combat climate change, conserve marine resources and promote viable ecosystems. We play a leading country role in Climate Studies through the work of Professor Michael Taylor and colleagues in the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST). During 2018/2019, the group contributed to a Special Report on Climate Change and Land that was published by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The Campus conducts research and advocacy through the Centre for Marine Sciences (CMS), the Discovery Bay Marine Lab (DBML), and the Coastal Dynamic Modeling Laboratory at Mona Geoinformatics Institute Blue (MGIBlue). The Department of Geography and Geology and the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences also continue to provide research data and recommendations on land degradation and disaster risk management.
$$

The UWI, Mona Campus Contribution to National Development Goals
$$
There are understandable parallels between national goals, global imperatives and the strategic vision of a university campus. The four National Goals that jointly strive to empower Jamaicans to achieve their fullest potential, to secure a cohesive and just society for all, to ensure economic prosperity, and to create a healthy environment are indivisible from those we have attempted to achieve through access, knowledge brokering, policy research, and expansion of curricula. The Mona Campus conducts and disseminates policy-oriented research that is intended to assist in the growth and development of the Jamaican economy. Responding to the needs of industry, teaching programmes and courses are offered through the Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM), while new programmes have been launched in Sports and in creative industries including Music, Animation, and Film.  
$$

OUR COMMITMENT TO THE FUTURE
$$
Much more than a place of learning, a driver of multi- disciplinary scientific innovation, a workplace for our employees, a partner in Jamaican national development and one of the satellites of the regional University of the West Indies, to those who hold the reins of this institution as caretakers over a determinate period, the Mona Campus is an enshrined legacy of our society’s heritage. Management of this Campus is an enormous responsibility to carry out and one that we do with pride and commitment, attempting to not only preserve its majesty as a site, but to ensure that the Campus anticipates future technologies and the changing demands of future generations. By maximizing our resources intelligently and with defined goals, and setting out a clearly signposted road map for the years ahead, we will ensure that we continue to build on the firmest foundations laid down by past architects who were similarly entrusted, to create a sustainable future for this space, our University of choice.

To be the University of First Choice
$$
Standing tall in our vision is the hope that the Mona Campus must be the preferred choice for the many communities we serve: students, neighbours, research affiliates and industry partners;  and that government and civil society leaders see us as a major resource for supporting policy and socio-economic development initiatives. 

In 2018, we assessed the uptake of secondary education leading to tertiary education choices and found, according to the most recent census, that the Jamaican population possessing tertiary education qualifications increased from 12.3%in 2001to 12.8%in 2011.1Over the same inter-censal period, the Jamaican population aged 15and over gaining a secondary education,  declined from 55.5%in 2001to 52.7%in 2011. In light of a waning uptake of secondary education, and its implications for a growing under-education in this society, our current drive in the second decade of the twenty-first century to increase access to a university education is both timely and necessary for revitalizing Caribbean development. In the 2018/19academic year our total student registration showed a 3%increase over the previous academic year. Our marketing in high schools to encourage secondary students into tertiary education stimulates the necessary expansion of both levels of education. 

Although minimal gains were experienced, we were nonetheless able to achieve a steady rise in student registration at the Mona Campus between 2017/2018and 2018/2019. The Campus in 2018/2019registered 19,599students, the highest number ever registered in the 71years, providing more access than ever before. This was only possible through the efforts of the entire Mona Campus team maximizing the available resources. 
$$

Further Expansion of the Mona Western Jamaica Campus
$$
On Friday, March 22, 2019, a Ground Breaking Ceremony was held on Barnett site in Montego Bay to signal the start of construction of the new Mona Western Jamaica Campus. 

The development of The UWI Mona Western Jamaica Campus (The UWI-WJC) will provide: more tertiary opportunities in Western Jamaica (access); more academic and industry partnerships through collaboration with Barnett Limited (alignment) and; another step toward restoring the financial health of The UWI.

The Campus is expected to have a world class School of Management that caters to Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), as well as Financial and Tourism Management. A world class School of Engineering will provide the technical skillset for the BPO sector. 

Minister of Tourism, The Hon. Edmund Bartlett, expressed his delight at the ceremony. “To see this vision now become a reality under the leadership of Professor Dale Webber, augurs well for tourism and our human capital development strategy.” 
$$

Introduction
$$
In this section, we will look at the incentives and actions undertaken to ensure that current and potential students view us as their University of Choice. During the year 2018/2019 we continued to emphasize student inclusivity, provide financial and housing supports to increase student intake and improve the quality of life on the Campus. We also made determined efforts to expand international and regional enrolment, improve teaching and learning tools through our digital platforms, and validate the successes of our students.
$$

Financing the Dream
$$
To assist qualified students to gain entry to the Mona Campus, a number of scholarships and bursaries were made available to students through the Office of Student Financing (OSF) valuing over JMD$ 900 million. We provided financial assistance based on academic merit and economic need. Several Faculties normally offer bursaries and prizes to high performing students. We feature some new departmental supports that were awarded for the 2018/2019 academic year. 

The Library was also host of the Emerald Ambassador Programme which awarded a second-year student USD$ 500 for winning the competition to become Ambassador for the year. The selected Ambassador served as a Campus Library liaison between Emerald Publishing Limited, United Kingdom, and the student body, helping to raise awareness, value and usage of the UWI Emerald databases through targeted outreach initiatives. The Library was also one of the largest recruiters of student employees. For the reporting period, approximately 228 students were employed which facilitated their registration engagements.  

The Business Development Office (BDO) streamlined initiatives to advance the strategic pillar of providing access to The UWI. A total of JMD$ 1.97 million was collected from its commercial tenants as contributions to the Principal’s Scholarship Fund; scholarships valued at JMD$1 million were provided from Restaurants Associates Limited Group (RAL) for the Burger King and Little Caesars outlets on the Campus to support two (2) students for full tuition fees, meal vouchers, and book expenses each academic year. These scholarships are administered by the Office of Student Financing. The BDO also negotiated and obtained 60 meal vouchers valued at JMD$ 1,000 each from Little Caesars and Burger King. These were distributed to needy students during final exams 2018/2019 through student bodies such as the Guild, and the Office of Special Student Services. A total of six (6) student workers were also employed by the BDO. 
$$

The UWI Development and Endowment Fund (UWIDEF)
$$
The UWI Development and Endowment Fund (UWIDEF) is a non-profit charitable organization, which was incorporated after Hurricane Gilbert devastated the Mona Campus in 1988. 

Since its inception, UWIDEF has raised and/or provided almost JMD$1 biillion of assistance to the Mona Campus for critical areas of research, funding for scholarships and much needed capital improvement projects.

For the academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, UWIDEF awarded over 70 scholarships and bursaries. Scholarships awarded were in excess of $JMD 10 million. New scholarships established during this period included:
$$

The Erasmus+ Mobility Programme
$$
The International Students Office guides and supports faculty and staff in their applications to participate in various programmes and in submitting bids for participation in the Erasmus+ Mobility Programme. A joint bid submitted by the Universidad de Valladolid and The UWI, Mona for the European Commission’s Erasmus+ International Credit Mobility Project was successful, and the Project has been extended for an additional four (4) years. During the 2018/2019 academic year four (4) students and three (3) faculty members visited Valladolid with full funding under the project. 
$$

Strengthening our Position
$$
Attracting international students has been emphasized as one of the criteria under which The UWI is ranked by the Times Higher Education (THE). Having made its debut in the THE ranking in 2018, the Mona Campus gathered momentum to improve its competitive position and to strengthen areas of weakness in the ranking. International students bring their intellectual strengths and cultural difference to the classroom or research laboratories, providing our students with a vicarious means of engaging with the global world right here in Jamaica. To this end, efforts were made by a number of entities on the Campus to attract more international students and to increase research connections and publication output.

The International Students Office (ISO) cited the 2018/2019 academic year as one of both challenges and successes in reaching international candidates. The main challenge from an international perspective pertained to the image of the country. The view of Jamaica as a “dangerous” country continued to thwart efforts at recruiting a greater number of international students and attracting both Study Abroad and Exchange students. Much of the year was spent managing various public relations issues having to do with the imposed Zone of Special Operations in various parts of the Island – and particularly in Western Jamaica where our satellite Campus is based. Despite this, the ISO experienced some noteworthy successes such as the extension of funding arrangements by the European Commission, as well as a successful promotional tour of Canadian universities in Ontario. While participating in events overseas during the year, it was heartening to note that despite some reservations voiced, The UWI remained the institution of choice for international partners seeking academic collaborations in the Caribbean.

The ISO hosted 27 Exchange and Study Abroad students during Semester Two, 11 students from Colgate University (located in Hamilton, New York) and 15 Special International Groups during the period under review. These included delegations from Howard University, Washburn University, University of Pittsburgh, University College of Dublin, the European Commission, and the International Federation of the Red Cross. It is expected that the majority of these will lead to formal Agreements in the 2019/2020 academic year. 

The UWI School Nursing (UWISON) welcomed two (2) students from the University of Cagliari, Italy, on a four-month Study Abroad Programme to gain experience in research. Both students completed critical aspects of their research projects under the supervision of Professor Eulalia Kahwa. One student from McMaster University, Canada, visited UWISON to complete her fieldwork for her project Documenting the Status of Nursing and Midwifery Human Resources in Jamaica, the latter also a key activity of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Collaborating Centre. Professor Kahwa, who serves as Deputy Director for the Centre and leads its major activities, co-supervised this student with colleagues from McMaster University.

The Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM) hosted a group of 13 students from Clayton State University, Georgia, as part of the Study Abroad component of their programme. The students were accompanied by Professor Alphonso Ogbuehi. They participated in lectures, site visits and were exposed to various cultural experiences. The MSBM proposes further dialogue with Clayton State University in 2019/2020 with a view to extending this partnership. In a similar vein, a team of faculty members from the MSBM visited the Florida Atlantic University (FAU) College of Business to explore an opportunity to form a collaborative partnership in faculty exchanges, research collaboration, and study abroad programmes. 

Two (2) undergraduate students in the Social Work Unit had the opportunity to travel with Dr. Claudette Crawford-Brown to the University of Applied Sciences, Utrecht, in the Netherlands. During their stay, the students interacted with social work students on a Netherlands Project which    examined    Human    Trafficking    in    Jamaica.    To    further    strengthen    the    international    connection with The Netherlands, eight (8) students from University College of Utrecht, accompanied by their professor, were also hosted by The UWI Psychology Unit in collaboration with the Department of Community Health in October 2018.

Based on an agreement with the Global Institute of Software Technology (GIST) in China, the first cohort of the BSc in Software Engineering programme which is being offered at The UWI China Institute of Information Technology (UWI-CIIT), left for China on September 4, 2018. Under the agreement, UWI students complete the first two years at UWI and the last two years in China. As part of the programme, students also complete a six-month paid internship at an IT company in the Suzhou Industrial Park. What is more, graduating students receive a diploma from GIST and a Bachelors degree from The UWI.
$$

Increasing Access Through Online Delivery 
$$
Online delivery of programmes opens up access to our education resources and allows many students whose work schedules, domestic responsibilities or physical mobility denies them the opportunity to access offerings by The UWI. A number of initiatives were undertaken to support the expansion of online delivery in 2018/2019. The Campus Office of Online Learning (COOL) was established in January 2019 to lead the expansion of online delivery of courses and programmes across the Campus. The focus of the Office has been on encouraging a more effective use of the Campus’ Learning Management System (LMS) for teaching and learning, guiding the conversion of existing courses for blended and online delivery, and reviewing and drafting guidelines to facilitate standardization of existing online delivery efforts at the Campus level. The COOL is central to the fulfillment of The UWI’s Digital Transformation initiative.  

The Campus increased course repositories on the online platform, Our Virtual Learning Environment-Moodle (OurVLE-Moodle), by 26%, from 2,300 to 2,892. Currently, the Faculty of Humanities and Education leads the way in online programme offerings. 

During the 2018/2019 academic year, 455 students were registered in online programmes of which 72% were studying in Humanities and Education followed by 21% in Medical Sciences.  Overall, more postgraduate students (60%) were registered online compared to undergraduate students (40%).  

The Sir Arthur Lewis Institute for Social and Economic Studies (SALISES) sought to increase access for students, by converting the face-to-face MSc Development Studies to online delivery mode. In October 2018, SALISES advertised its MSc programme on the masterstudies.com recruitment platform. Use of the website yielded 59,926 impressions, 2,975 clicks, and 226 interested applicants. The online programme, which is expected to commence in the academic year 2020/2021, will result in increased student access, regionally and internationally. Efforts to provide more online programmes, with aggressive marketing, is likely to widen access to a tertiary education, especially for international students.
$$

New Courses and Programmes Introduced for Students
$$
A number of academic courses and programmes were rolled out as a means of attracting new students. Students themselves request new options for programmes and courses that outfit them for a changing world of work. For many students, finding a job means possibly creating a job for themselves. 

The changing technologies of communication, industry and business models also require us as a University to review our curricula and outfit the programmes with state-of-the-art literature, new formats for delivery and cross- disciplinary choices. For example, an MSc in Media Management, offered jointly by the Mona School of Business and Management and the Caribbean School of Media and Communication (CARIMAC), was approved for delivery in 2019/2020. The first of its kind in the Caribbean, the programme will deliver instruction in the management of contemporary media systems inclusive of own-account enterprises. Graduates are expected to be effective media managers who can adapt to changing platforms. The Faculty of Humanities and Education also introduced two (2) full fee-paying programmes, the BA in History and Journalism and the BA in Music and Performance Studies. As part of the drive for financial self-sufficiency, the Faculty secured a JMD$ 4 million grant from the CHASE Foundation for the purchase of musical instruments. These programmes, with specific provisions for practica and internships, are expected to produce job-ready graduates well acquainted with industry standards.

The Department of Medicine launched a new DM in Dermatology on July 1, 2019. This programme was long in gestation, although there was a great need to provide locally qualified dermatologists since there were no prior local/regional opportunities for training. The first cohort saw four (4)  students being admitted, with a teaching complement of five (5) dermatologists.

To take advantage of new developments, the Department of Computing (DoC) launched a new programme in Applied Data Science. Data science is among the most needed skills of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Big Data and Machine Learning are playing important roles in several sectors. The programme is offered at the certificate, advanced diploma, and master’s degree levels.

Within the Faculty of Social Sciences, four (4) economics courses on offer at the St. Augustine Campus were adopted for delivery in 2019/2020: Urban and Regional Economics; Energy Economics; Health Economics: Theory and Policy; and Labour Economics. In addition, The UWI Centre for Disability Studies (UWICDS) developed the following courses for delivery in 2019/2020: Understanding Persons with Disabilities; Disability, Law and Society; and Disability and Development. These courses collectively serve to broaden the appeal of the social sciences to individuals and organizations.

Responding specifically to the national development agenda and to the SDG on climate change, The Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) partnered with The UWI’s Disaster Risk Reduction Centre (DRRC) on developing three courses for the region and the first section of a Master’s degree programme on disaster risk reduction/ disaster risk management. The courses cover critical areas of disaster risk management including leadership, risk reduction and health management.

Engaging Students through Teaching and Learning
$$
In addition to forging partnerships that were beneficial to students’ professional development, efforts to improve teaching and learning generally on the Campus are continuous and an ongoing strategy to respond to student and industry needs. During the 2018/2019 academic year a number of initiatives were added to engage students both academically and professionally. Extensive reviews were undertaken in 2018/2019 of the postgraduate and undergraduate Nursing programmes to achieve compliance with the World Health Organization’s Revised Competencies for Nursing Education and Practice (2016) and to reflect the priority areas of the Nursing Council of Jamaica and the Regional Nursing Body. An implementation target date is set for September 2021/2022. 

To improve student learning, the Department of Computing began using the HackerRank ™ platform. The online platform allows faculty members to create programming problems to which students submit written solutions. The submissions are automatically tested and graded, and the students are immediately informed about the suitability of their submissions. Students are also permitted to resubmit solutions, encouraging them to learn from errors.  At the Western Jamaica Campus, a concerted effort was made to equip students with special skills to elevate their writing from high school to university level. At the Institute of Caribbean Studies, students were provided with detailed rubrics for all their assignments, thus improving  their performance in presenting coursework. 

The Health Professions Education Unit (HPEU) through its Faculty Development Workshops on Item-Writing, Blueprinting, Standard Setting, Flipped Classroom, and Leadership promoted and enhanced the quality of teaching, learning and student development in the Faculty of Medical Sciences during 2018/2019. Consultations in quality assurance and accreditation by the HPEU (to MBBS, Dentistry, Diagnostic Imaging) further contributed to improving the quality of academic undergraduate programmes in the Faculty of Medical Sciences.

The UWI Mona Library continued to play a major role in supporting teaching and learning through its thesis scrutiny, consultation and proactive programmes.  During the year under review, the Library hosted 188 theses consultations and scrutinized 47 theses.  It also conducted workshops for postgraduate students on Plagiarism, Referencing, Endnote, and Thesis Preparation. The Library hosted 3 workshops with librarians and the Faculties on avoiding predatory journals.  During Research Days 2019, the Library conducted 14 workshops/seminars focusing on a number of areas including APA referencing, Chicago referencing, digitization, and copyright.   One hundred and eighty-two (182) persons participated in these workshops.  

Such efforts, undertaken in each department and faculty over the 2018/2019 academic year to engage students with novel information in different teaching and learning strategies, will incrementally improve student academic performance and redound to The UWI’s research endeavours and the region’s human capital

Student Development: Fostering a Culture of Research 
$$
Graduate student enrolment at the Mona Campus is heavily geared towards taught Masters programmes,  with a smaller but highly motivated group of research students working towards Masters and Doctors of Philosophy degrees.  The large Masters cohorts represent an opportunity to prepare students for entry into Doctoral studies.  The period of graduate studies training is also well-placed to develop research and writing skills of students to enhance The UWI publication profile.  During the previous academic year, a number of departments led special projects to strengthen students’ research and writing skills.  
$$

Initiatives By Faculty
$$
The Office of Graduate Studies and Research (OGSR) hosted a Getting Started workshop that was incorporated into the Orientation exercise. A series of ongoing measures were also implemented throughout the year to improve the graduate supervision experience, among these: guidelines were introduced for chairing Oral examinations and PhD upgrade seminars, and specific criteria were established for appointing supervisors. Mentorship programmes were implemented to further enhance the level of research productivity among graduate students. The Mona Association of Postgraduate Students (MAPS) also hosted a Thesis workshop in the first semester. The Library continues to be an active participant in all activities.

There were a number of initiatives at Faculty level specifically geared at fostering a sense of community and strengthening the research proficiencies of our students:   

<table>

Graduate students from The UWI School of Nursing (UWISON) participated in the School’s biweekly Journal Club providing opportunities for peer review of proposals, manuscripts, and research findings.  A similar initiative was embraced in the Department of Microbiology where staff and students at different levels were encouraged to present and discuss articles of interest from reputable journals. In addition, the Department of Microbiology hosted weekly research meetings where carefully selected papers were reviewed for content, impact, and methodology. Different members of staff led the discussions each week. DM students were also advised to do the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) programme on research ethics in the first year of the programme and to submit research papers to the Faculty’s Annual Research Conference. During 2018/2019, five (5) postgraduate students in the Department were either current or newly accepted National Institute of Health (NIH) Fogarty Scholars. The scholars comprised Ms. Suzette Cameron, Dr. Ynolde Ley-Thomas, Dr. Camille Blake, Ms. Tiffany Butterfield and Mr. Chadwic Mears. 
$$

Research and Publication Grants
$$
Eighty-four (84) graduate students received funding from Research and Publication Grants to support their research efforts.  The 2018/2019 allocation for the Mona Campus for Post Graduate Research was JMD$ 31,858,553. Grants were used to purchase equipment and supplies; for assistance with research; to present papers and posters at international conferences; and to facilitate training and observation at overseas laboratories. Developmental activities, such as workshops, were continuously supported throughout the year, supporting faculty drives to foster a culture of research. 
$$

NIH Fogarty Scholars
$$
Ms. Tiffany Butterfield and Mr. Chadwic Mears, NIH Fogarty Scholars in the Department of Microbiology, who are being supervised by Dr. Joshua Anzinger, have already received advanced training at several research institutions. Ms. Butterfield, while at the University of Buffalo, gained the ability to perform bioinformatic pathway analysis for her research project and Mr. Mears gained training in diagnostic arbovirus techniques for his research project while at the Wadsworth Laboratory in Albany, New York. Mr. Mears was also selected for advanced sequencing training at the Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, sponsored by the Japanese Government.
$$

Student Internships: Facilitating Industry Partnerships
$$
The Department of Computing (DoC) added nine (9) more companies to the list of 29 where students were placed as interns. The UWI-NCB Digital Agile Lab, which the Department manages in collaboration with the Mona School of Business and Management, commenced the second cohort of 15 interns and trained them over a period of 16 weeks. The interns were trained to fill key roles such as Software Developers, Customer Experience and Design experts, and Data Scientists at the National Commercial Bank (NCB). All 15 interns were subsequently hired by the NCB, a strong example of the Academic/Industry partnership at work.

Five (5) students from the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) were beneficiaries of the Annual Huawei Jamaica Seeds for the Future programme. They are:  Mr. Jachin Mullings, Mr. Jhamali Vassell, Mr. Jahmin Chambers, Ms. Kaycilee Wright and Mr. D’Angelo Campbell. The Programme seeks to develop local information and communications technology talent, enhance knowledge transfer, promote a greater understanding of, and interest in, the ICT sector, and improve and encourage regional building and participation in the digital community. The students participated in a two-week internship at Huawei in China with the company covering all major expenses. 

Part of the mission of the Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM) is to “foster innovation for the positive transformation of Caribbean enterprises through the development of world-class business professionals and research-based solutions”. To this end, they partnered with approximately 20 companies in Kingston and Montego Bay to provide practical solutions to business problems, through the MSBM Graduate Programme Field Project. Approximately 120 students from both the Mona and Western Jamaica Campuses recently completed their projects through a partnership with both public and private sector companies across a range of industries including finance, aviation, marketing and information technology.

Recognizing Excellence
$$
One of the enduring objectives of The UWI Strategic Plan is the development of student attributes that embody the ideal graduate; acknowledging the successes of those who have made the Campus proud through their sterling achievements reinforces the commitment to this objective.  The Mona Campus is proud of those students who excelled in various spheres. 

As part of the Annual Student Orientation activities, the Faculty of Social Sciences launched an essay competition on the topic The UWI at 70: The Relevance of a University Education in the 21stCentury Workplace. Ms. Maia Labastide, the competition winner, presented her paper at the Dean’s Welcome Ceremony. Mr. Desmond Campbell, a Nursing student at the Mona Western Jamaica Campus, was the recipient of the Nursing Student of the Year award for 2018/2019.  This award was granted by LASCO and the Nursing Association of Jamaica. Mr. Campbell represented the first male to earn the title. The win was significant for opening doors to diversity in the health professions and for highlighting UWISON’s success over the last four (4) years.

Other students who were recognized at the national level were valuable ambassadors of The UWI brand.  Mr. Jordon Freeman received the 2018 Innovation Youth Award for his reduced calorie "Healthy Sugar"; and the 2019 Governor General’s Achievement Award.  Dr. Phylicia Ricketts, who recently completed her PhD in Applied Physics at The UWI, Mona, was awarded the Prime Minister’s Youth Award for Innovation in Science and Technology. Dr. Aldeam Facey received the Prime Minister’s Youth Award for Excellence in the category of Innovation in Science and Technology for work done while pursuing his PhD in Biochemistry. The study quantified adipocytic contributions to basal lactate and created a novel metabolic profile of Jamaican athletes. Ms. Eleanor Terrelonge, a Graduate student in The Department of Basic Medical Sciences and founder of the Jamaica Climate Change Youth Council (JCCYC), was among the 2018 Prime Minister’s Youth Award recipients. Dr. Shadae Foster, a PhD Biochemistry graduate of The UWI, Mona Campus, was also the 2018 recipient of the Young Scientists Award from the Ministry of Science and Technology. 

The UWI brand took further global accolades during the previous academic year when a number of talented students were recognized internationally for their outstanding performance. Mr. Cornel Bogle, First Class Honours student in Literatures in English, was the proud winner of the 2018 Herb Wyile Prize in Canadian Literature. His award-winning essay, The Politics of Homosociality in Austin Clarke’s ‘In the City,’ was published in Studies in Canadian Literature. As a requirement for the BA in Librarianship, Mr. Demar Ludford, was attached to the Brooklyn Public Library in the United States as an intern. While collating and classifying a set of archival collections, Mr. Ludford found a subset of papers on Martha Gayle, a Jamaican who travelled to the United States in the ninteen twenties and became a naturalized citizen in 1947. Driven by intellectual curiosity, Mr. Ludford wrote an essay about Miss Gayle which was highly commended and later published on the website of the Brooklyn Public Library. 

After a series of technical and behavioural interviews with representatives from Goldman Sachs, Mr. Michael Calloo, a student from the Department of Computing, succeeded in getting an internship at the Technology Division of Goldman Sachs Services (Asia) Limited in Hong Kong in the summer of 2019. He was subsequently offered a full-time job starting in January 2020, thus forging new paths for other students in educational and job opportunities. 

The Mona Association of Postgraduate Students Debate Team, comprised of students from the Department of Government, were the 2019 Champions of The UWI Inter-Campus Postgraduate Debate Competition. The debaters were accompanied by their coach, Ms. Kemesha Kelly, a Lecturer in the Department of Government. 

In the Faculty of Engineering, The UWI Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Student Branch placed third in the IEEE Southeastern Conference Robotics Open Competition in Alabama, in 2019. Mr. Dominic Mills-Howell (MPhil Mathematics) attended the 69t Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in Lindau, Germany from June 30 to July 5, 2019. He was one of 580 young scientists representing 89 countries and chosen out a pool of more than 20,000 candidates from all over the world. He was the only Jamaican representative. The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings foster exchange among scientists of different generations, cultures, and disciplines. Annually, around 30-40 Nobel Laureates convene in Lindau to meet the next generation of leading scientists, including undergraduates, PhD students, and post-doc researchers from around the world. 

Mr. Chevano Baker, graduate of The University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, was selected as the 2019 Rhodes Scholar. He graduated with a BSc (First Class Honours) in Actuarial Science after winning the prestigious UWI Open Scholarship in 2013. He was then awarded a JN Foundation/University of Birmingham Legacy Scholarship, where he pursued an MSc in Financial Economics.  The Rhodes Scholarship is tenable at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. 

These students, and many more like them, are ambassadors of The UWI personifying the ideal graduate while  enhancing  our brand. Their successes demonstrate that we prepare students for the local, regional and global market as recommended in The UWI Strategic Plan.
$$

Achievements in Sports 
$$
Thirteen (13) new graduate programmes were approved for future delivery. These cover areas such as pain management; applied data science; coaching; kinetics; biomechanics; and strength and conditioning. Students at the Mona Campus also celebrated some noticeable sporting wins for 2018/2019:

<point>
Akim Fraser, a scholarship athlete, was named to the Jamaica Scorpion Cricket Team in February 2019 where he took five (5) wickets on his debut in first class cricket and was named “Man of the Match”. He was also named to the West Indies A team and played in a friendly match against India. In this encounter he took four (4) wickets overall. The UWI Mona team, an all student team, won the Jamaica Cricket Association Junior Cup Championship and placed third in the Jamaica Cricket Association Senior T20 Championship.

<point>
The Mona Campus male football team won both of the Jamaica Intercollegiate Sports Association (Intercol) Football competitions (the Greg Garrel Knockout and the Intercol League) for the first time. The team featured both Sports scholarship and non-scholarship students. 
$$

Ja Bio Plastics
$$
The MSBM continues to lead teams in The UWI Vincent HoSang Venture Competition (UWIVC). Five teams represented The UWI at the National Business Model Competition (NBMC) - Ja Bio Plastics, Pree Labs, Carib Voxx, Align and ReRoute - at the final round of the competition in March 2019. The UWI placed first and third in the competition, with two (2) of the five (5) student-entrepreneur teams securing a combined cash prize of JMD$ 2.5 million.  The first place prize went to Team JA Bio Plastics, a student-entrepreneur team comprising Mr. Jordon Freeman and Ms. Samantha Williams. The team presented an eco-friendly alternative to plastic bags which copped them a cash prize of $JMD 2 million and an all-expense paid trip to the International Business Model Competition later that year.  Although they did not place among the top three winners at the International Competition, they received honourable mention, shining the spotlight, once again, on the Mona Campus’ commitment to preserving and protecting the environment. The MSBM provides the teams with mentorship, training and support. These students competed against thirteen other teams across four (4) universities - The UWI, Northern Caribbean University, University of Technology Jamaica and Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts. This is the 2n  consecutive year that The UWI has won the Competition.
$$

The Rush Alert App 
$$
A main priority of The UWI Mona is to provide a safe environment for our staff and students. In helping us to fulfil this mandate, a four-member team comprising Mr. Marvin Richards, Mr. Odaine Williams, Mr. Jhamali Vassel, and Mr. Ramon McLaren created a security notification mobile application feature, Rush Alert, to address the security concerns of The UWI community. The Rush Alert App enables an individual in distress to send status alerts to a list of predefined contacts. Pre-coded messages, or alerts, (e.g., “I feel unsafe”) are available to users to indicate their current state to their contacts. If a user fails to “check in” the application will initiate the issuance of a corresponding status alert to their list of contacts. Analytics from Rush Alert will also be used to inform security practices on the Campus. Approval is now being sought for the implementation and use of the App. 
$$

Student Housing
$$
The Halls of Residence function as learning communities for students who are being prepared for twenty-first century leadership. This is in keeping with the strategic aim of The University of the West Indies to provide nurturing environments which support teaching, learning and student development. The mission of the Halls is therefore to provide an aesthetically and intellectually appealing environment which fosters the qualitative advancement of student learners through creative, engaging and student-centred programmes and methodologies. 
$$

A University for All 
$$
For the 2018/2019 period the Office of Student Services and Development (OSSD) welcomed a total of 53 students with disabilities – 26 males and 27 females. Of that total 47 were registered undergraduate students and the remaining 6 were graduate students. Linked to this, The UWI Centre for Disability Studies in collaboration with the OSSD secured summer internship for six (6) students with disabilities. Additionally, there are approximately 21 current or former Wards of the State currently enrolled in programmes at The UWI, one of whom is a scholarship recipient.  

The Mona Social Services (MSS), UWI, awarded eight (8) scholarships for the 2018/2019 academic year valued at approximately JMD$ 2 million, to residents of African Gardens, August Town, Bedward Gardens, Hermitage and Mona Common. These scholarships provide residents who live in the underserved communities surrounding the Campus an opportunity to pursue Degree programmes at The UWI. The recipients are all mandated to undertake 52 community service hours annually and participate in at least 2 personal development sessions. The sessions are aimed at helping to enrich their University life experiences and assist them in coping with a different environment to that which they are accustomed. 

Thirty-five (35) students attached to the Dentistry Programme and 236 students in the MBBS programme were granted tuition waivers for the 2018/2019 academic year; the total dollar value amounted to JMD$ 477,446,668. In addition to providing scholarships and grants, some students were also provided with opportunities to earn additional income. Twenty-five (25) vulnerable women received financial assistance through the Mary Seacole Hall student worker programme. 

Increasingly, the Mona Campus has ensured that its buildings and facilities are accommodating to the physically challenged, that we mark out and help those who need financial assistance and that we encourage access to different language groups. Potential and current students are informed of available subventions to assist them in making life decisions about education. 

Students are our number one clients and most important partners. Access to a UWI education is perhaps the most significant opportunity for self-actualization. The multi-faceted approaches of the Mona Campus in terms of entry opportunities, financing, course modification and development, internships and research are critical parts of the Campus’ vision and success. The Mona Campus stands proud in its efforts to provide this opportunity for ALL.

Outreach Contribution to Social Development 
$$
Public service is an important function performed by The UWI staff, student and service entities.  Engaging in public service exposes the Campus community of scholars and practitioners to real world demands and allows for a continuous interaction between theory and praxis in disciplines taught at the University. A number of initiatives were undertaken in 2018/2019 that broadened access to UWI’s products and services. 

The Campus engages in an ongoing set of marketing activities to demonstrate its potential value to our customers and stakeholders throughout the academic year. A number of initiatives were undertaken in 2018/2019 to attract prospective recruits, especially secondary school students, to the Mona and Western Jamaica Campuses. The Faculty of Science and Technology held its annual CAPE workshops on the subjects of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geography, Mathematics, and Physics at both the Mona and Western Jamaica Campuses.  Since 2003, the Chemistry and Physics Departments have hosted over 23,000 students in 160 workshops. The workshops not only reflect a significant marketing and recruitment strategy, but equally stimulate interest in STEM disciplines and promote learning outcomes for all involved, from workshop facilitators, to secondary school teachers and, most importantly, to secondary school students. 

The UWI School of Nursing (UWISON) co-opted other members within Jamaica to host two mental health forums under the theme Resilience and Mental Health in Young People. Health care providers and educators were in attendance from the University Hospital of the West Indies, as well as students and guidance counsellors from Campion College, Jamaica College, Mona High School and Papine High School. The sessions were streamed live on Facebook, extending access to the global community. 

A Jamaica International Chapter of the International Association of Eating Disorders Professionals has been established in the Department of Sociology Psychology and Social Work (DSPSW). The International Association of Eating Disorders Professionals (IAEDP) is one of the leading bodies worldwide in providing training for eating disorder specialists. IAEDP has asked Dr. Caryl James Bateman, Lecturer in the Psychology Unit, to chair the Jamaica Chapter.

The Estate Management Department (EMD) facilitated internships and practica for students to provide them with valuable experience for the world of work. Students from Papine High School, Excelsior High School, the MICO University College, and the Institute of International Recognized Qualifications (IIRQ) participated in these programmes. The students gained knowledge and hands-on experience in the areas of building and electrical services.

Three (3) students from the Psychology Unit were placed on a four-month internship at the Mona Social Services from January to April 2019. These students were assigned to the Hope Valley Experimental and August Town Primary Schools. This was part of a Resilience Building Programme which was initiated as a response to the increased murders being committed in the Greater August Town area and to bolster resilience and develop coping strategies for students. The sessions included discussions on promoting promoting peaceful spaces, conflict resolution, communication and working in teams. Pre-test and post-test assessments were conducted to measure impact and provide direction for future interventions. Seventy (70) students participated in the Programme. 

The Faculty of Sport, aided by a grant from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), launched the Community Inclusion Project, a pilot project targeting children between the ages of 9 and 16 to expose them to the values and ethics of sports.  Youngsters from the community of August Town were counselled on vocational opportunities in and around sport and given the opportunity to mingle and compete with some of the top sportsmen and sportswomen in the region. Another portion of the CDB grant was used to commence the Regional Emerging Athlete Development Programme. National sporting organizations around the region nominated an athlete from which three (3) were selected for the programme. The athletes, accompanied by their coaches, had extensive baseline medical and sports science testing done in Barbados, following which customized programmes were forwarded to their coaches. 

The athletes will be retested in the next academic year to monitor their progress. The Faculty of Sport also launched the Pace Like Fire programme scouting fast bowlers. Testing was conducted in multiple sites in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, St. Lucia, Barbados and Jamaica in which any fast bowler was invited to bowl balls which were measured using a radar gun. The top 20 were then assessed by an expert panel of elite coaches and were taken into a camp at Cave Hill for intensive baseline testing and training to enhance their bowling technique. The entire process was filmed by Flow Sports working in conjunction with UWItv and was aired as a multi-episode series on Flow Sports.

In November 2018, the Western Jamaica Campus (WJC) introduced an initiative in public education around issues of child and adolescent development as part of a larger idea to build out a Centre of Excellence in Human and Behavioral Sciences at the WJC. Weekly public engagement sessions in the form of lectures, seminars, workshops and panel discussions, were held exploring such topics as Parenting in the 21stCentury; Fathering in Jamaica; Understanding Disabilities among Children and Adolescents; and Promoting Healthy Body Imaging among Children and Adolescents in the Age of Social Media. The series was developed and delivered by the WJC Psychology Unit and reached a combined audience of approximately 1,000 parents, teachers, health and education professionals, and students from communities and institutions across St. James. 

While community intervention aids social development, the Campus community also benefits by having to stretch its disciplinary boundaries to respond to concrete issues and demands for training or outreach support from our stakeholders.

Mona Social Services Kitchen Garden Initiative
$$
MSS received grant funding of approximately JMD$ 5 million through the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica (EFJ), to install a Waste Water Management System initially in two basic schools in Greater August Town - August Town Seventh Day Adventist and Hermitage Basic Schools. The Waste Water Management System involves installation of tanks for harvesting rain water, a water pump to direct grey water from the kitchen to the garden, and a solar panel to power the   water pump. The harvested rain water will be used for sanitation purposes while the grey and rain water should provide continuous water for the gardens. The implementation of a Waste Water Management System is a sustainable way of continuing the Kitchen Garden Project which was established in 2013.  In the Greater August Town Basic Schools construction and installation of this system will reduce food insecurities and boost health. This effort is linked to the second sustainable development goal - zero hunger, which aims to end hunger and malnutrition by 2030, and to ensure that everyone, especially children, have “access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round”.

Outreach Contribution to National Development 
$$
The Western Jamaica Campus hosted a Sustainable Cities Symposium under the theme Information Assurance and the Drive towards SMART City Status. The Symposium had solid support from the North Carolina-based Forsyth Technical Community College, the Mona School of Business and Management, the Jamaica Computer Society, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, and the Ministry of National Security. At the Symposium, the Campus Director of the WJC, Dr. Patrick Prendergast, was officially presented as co-chair of the newly established Mayor’s Advisory Council in recognition of the Campus’ consistency in education and advocacy for the planned development of the city of Montego Bay.  The other co-chair was prominent Montego Bay businessman, Mr. Fred Smith.

The Faculty of Social Sciences in collaboration with the Jamaica Red Cross hosted a Symposium in September 2018 under the theme Humanitarian Action through Partnership and Research in Support of Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience in which there was a wide cross section of industry and civil society represented. Attendees included: Major Errol Alliman, Former Chairman, Emergency Services, Jamaica Red Cross; Major Clive Davis, Director General, Office of Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Management (ODPEM); Dr Hossam Elsharkawi, Vice President, International Operations, Canadian Red Cross; Mrs. Gloria Goffe, Executive Director, Combined Disabilities Association; Mrs. Josephine Shields-Recass, Head, Country Cluster Support Team, IFRC; and Colonel Mahatma Williams, Colonel General Staff, Jamaica Defence Force.  The FSS used the event to launch its Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience Research Initiative with Dr. Dennis Edwards assigned as the Lead.  

The National Influenza Centre (NIC) under the leadership of Professor Monica Smikle, continued to perform the important functions of influenza surveillance and diagnosis in Jamaica in keeping with World Health Organization (WHO) terms of reference for National Influenza Centres. The NIC activities were supported by the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Health (MOH), Jamaica, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and The University of the West Indies. 
$$

Outreach Contribution to National Development2
$$
A Mosquito Research and Control Unit (MCRU) was established at The UWI as a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Health and Wellness (MOHW) and The UWI. Pivotal to the MCRU is the unique partnership with stakeholders for a coordinated strategy involving research, tracking and monitoring, and actively pursuing new ways to address the threat caused by mosquito-borne diseases. The MCRU will bring together a multi-disciplinary team of experts and scientists representing the spectrum of academia and public institutions with provision for engaging private institutions and international partners. Experts in the areas of entomology, virology and parasitology, epidemiology, data analytics, economics and social sciences, will be represented in tackling the challenge of vector-borne diseases through research.  The objective of the Unit is to provide solutions for mosquito control through three strategies; applied research, capacity building and resource development. 

These outreach activities are key to social cohesion and development and remind us that we are indeed a University for all.

Introduction SRP
$$
Pure and applied research must both be understood and appreciated by the University and its partners. While there are immediate outcomes of some research that can serve commerce or policy, some research raises the profile of the University on the global landscape, signalling our capacity for both stridency and innovative research,  and allowing where possible conversion into entrepreneurial benefits.  Partnerships are established at all levels, between staff and students, with our national and regional partners across islands, with our sister University of the West Indies campuses, and with our international connections. In building strategic partnerships in research we recognize the importance of our research integrity - the formal and informal ethics, standards, protocols and policies researchers follow in their environment, and that developing a partnership is inevitably a non-linear process involving many “starts” and “restarts”. While funding the research enterprise is an important ingredient, the spill on effect of stimulating and generating research at all levels and with strategic vibrant partnerships is unmeasurable for a university. Research is the lifeblood of our existence, running through the arteries of each discipline as they cater to the varied needs of our society and the raison d’etre of our University.  
$$

Research Publications 
$$
The Faculty of Medical Sciences has always led the way in publishing at the Mona Campus and continued to do so in 2018/2019.  Over the 2017 to 2019 period, a total of 12 articles were published in the high-profile journal The Lancet while three (3) appeared in Science, two (2) in Nature, and one (1) in The New England Journal of Medicine. The Faculty of Medical Sciences accounted for 50% of publications as compiled in the annual Campus Departmental Reports. 

The decline in the publication rate was due in part to the financial challenges being faced by the Campus. Despite the limited resources, however, researchers found creative means of connecting their research with critical areas of impact. Plans were also put in place for the re-establishment of The Mona Office of Research and Innovation (MORI).  MORI will provide the necessary support for measures that will help improve the quality and relevance of research outputs.

In celebration of The UWI’s 70thAnniversary, the Psychology Unit of the Department of Sociology Psychology and Social Work (DSPSW) in collaboration with the School for Graduate Studies and Research and the Board for Graduate Studies and Research, published a special issue of the Caribbean Journal of Psychology (CJP). The journal focuses on using a multidisciplinary approach to examine human behaviour and as such, integrates sociology, psychology, social psychology, history and poetics to investigate the Caribbean human experience. CJP was first published in 2004 and is currently published by The UWI Press.`
$$

Fostering a Culture of Research for Staff 
$$
An important aspect of a research culture is one in which the institution values individual and group research and values research time. A research culture recognizes the activities and competencies that are involved in the process of research and creates opportunities to disseminate and employ research findings and solutions for the collective good. Research is not restricted to those who have earned academic stripes already, but goes through all levels of staff to graduate and undergraduate  students and to all who are aware of its centrality. A research culture encompasses the values, expectations, attitudes and norms of our research communities. It influences researchers' career paths and determines the way that research is conducted and communicated.  Diversity, both in the wide array of research that is carried out by the University and in terms of the diversity of the Campus population and its partnerships benefits everyone. The Mona Campus underscores the importance of research and in this section attests to the value we place on the research initiatives of our faculty. 

The Principal facilitated staff who expressed an interest in attending Mixed Methods Research Conferences, understanding that transformation in research methodologies are important  triggers to  innovative research scholarship.  

The Faculty of Social Sciences (FSS) has continued to emphasize the importance of high-quality impactful research by encouraging and supporting the work of its academics and research students. In addition to the financial support and teaching relief that was provided at the departmental level, the Social Sciences Faculty Office allocated approximately JMD$ 1 million in financial support to colleagues’ research projects and has assigned forty-seven (47) student assistants to colleagues for research duties.  Additionally, a proposal has been written for an institutional research project to examine the Factors affecting research productivity in the FSS and FST.  The proposal has received Ethics approval and will commence in the 2019/2020 academic year.  The results of this project are expected to guide planning initiatives in the FSS as to the most effective means of increasing research output. 

The Faculty currently has seven (7) active research clusters in the areas of: Crime Prevention and Offender Management; Migration and Development; Social Policy; Sustainable Rural Agricultural Development; Youth; Economic Development Policy; and Behavioural Sciences.

The CETL also convened its first Technology Academy in August 2018 training ten (10) faculty members to use 21  century technologies for teaching. This was a 31 training programme for faculty to engage in hands-on technology training. It was specifically geared at developing a cadre of university teachers who would develop the skills and competencies in using 21s century technologies in the higher education classroom (face-to face or online) to advance teaching and learning and of course, support the strategic objectives of access and alignment. Eighteen (18) academic members of staff participated in the session. 
$$

Supervisor Development Course
$$
The Supervisor Development Course was introduced as a University-wide course in 2014 to improve the level of supervision particularly of research degree students. Lecturers are drawn from across the University and include the Principal, a former Pro Vice-Chancellor of Research and Graduate Studies with many successful supervisions to his credit.  

Over the years, Mona has adapted the course to target the focus of the Faculties.  Two Faculties, Social Sciences and Medical Sciences, have offered annual courses in collaboration with the Office of Graduate Studies.  Other Faculties have hosted at least one (1) course.  Topics covered include, Getting the Student Started, Grant Writing, Thesis Writing and Plagiarism. The regulations are also discussed in detail. 	

Over the years, Mona has adapted the course to target the focus of the Faculties.  Two Faculties, Social Sciences and Medical Sciences, have offered annual courses in collaboration with the Office of Graduate Studies.  Other Faculties have hosted at least one (1) course.  Topics covered include, Getting the Student Started, Grant Writing, Thesis Writing and Plagiarism. The regulations are also discussed in detail.

Research and Publication Fund
$$
For the 2018/2019 academic year, the Mona Campus received an allocation of JMD$ 6,068,953 for Research and Publication. A total of twenty (20) staff members were awarded Research and Publication Grants. The seed funding provided by the Research and Publication fund continues to be foundational to inspiring a research culture on the Campus for staff who are beginning to generate new and exciting research projects. 
$$

Research Days 
$$
The traditionally staged UWI, Mona Research Day activities led by the Director of Graduate Studies and Research, was held between Wednesday, February 6 and Friday, February 8, 2019 under the theme Powering Development through Partnerships in Research & Innovation as the University celebrated twenty (20) years of Research Days. Research Days provide an opportunity for The UWI to showcase research that is being done across the Campus. Over the years, the series of activities have sparked the interest of the government, the public and private sector, and other institutions that share The UWI mission of positively transforming the Caribbean and the wider world. 

Dr. Wayne Henry, Director General of the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), participated in this years’ event by presenting a paper which highlighted the contributions of 32 UWI academics to Vision 2030, Jamaica’s National Development Agenda, from concept stage and continuing throughout to the now implementation.

The event received tremendous support from The UWI community. There were over 100 posters on display and 53 interactive sessions covering areas including gender, the environment, marine science, community, energy, puppets in teaching, archaeology digs and natural products. A Policy Wall was also mounted which looked back at the contributions of UWI academics over the past 20 years to significant policies impacting Child Health, Ageing, HIV Prevention, Medium Size Enterprises, Climate Change, and Mangroves and Environmental Management. Finance Minister, Dr. Nigel Clarke, in his keynote address at the Opening Ceremony, emphasized the importance of research to social and economic development. To underscore the government’s commitment to research and development, a budget allocation will be made for research at the tertiary level. Research and development will also be included in Jamaica’s measurement of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as of September 2020. 

The Annual Research Day Awards was held to once again recognize the contributions of those in our community whose research has generated transformative solutions relevant to the region’s complex development. Their work is highlighted through the Awards Ceremony to encourage faculty to continue the tradition of knowledge-creation and to urge stakeholders in the public and private sectors to partner with The UWI to ensure the sustainability of the University’s research enterprise. This year over 75 researchers were recognized at the Awards for their contributions over the 2017/2018 academic year. 
$$

Grant Funding
$$
Over the years, grant funding has provided an opportunity for The UWI to conduct research beyond its current capacity.  Partnerships that are established under these agreements bridge the gap between the goals of the funding institutions and the outputs of scholarly research.  Administration at The UWI has also benefitted immensely from the percentage monetary allocations that accompany these arrangements. For the academic period August 2018 to March 2019, the following data was recorded for The UWI Mona Campus:


$$

Entrepreneurship and Innovation 
$$
The Mona Campus Entrepreneurial Committee was established to identify and accelerate the entrepreneurial possibilities that exist on the Campus. For the 2018/2019 academic year efforts were made to inculcate a mindset about entrepreneurship – being a problem seeker, a problem solver, and an innovator - among our staff and students and to facilitate the commercialization of ideas. To help fulfill its mandate the Committee worked closely with the Mona Office of Research and Innovation (MORI), the Mona Entrepreneurial and Commercialization Centre (MECC), the Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM) and Faculties that offer courses on entrepreneurship. The Mona Campus Entrepreneurial Committee also falls under the umbrella of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship arm of the School for Graduate Studies and Research, headed by Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Stephan Gift. In February 2019, the Mona Entrepreneurial and Commercialization Centre ran a Boot Camp that had 14 startup companies participating; of those, 8 were selected to participate in a twelve-week-long Entrepreneurship Development Programme. This was a project funded by the Development Bank of Jamaica. MECC provides guidance to aspiring entrepreneurs, and incubation to those that qualify. 
$$

Research: Outstanding Researchers 
$$
Along with an impressive publication output, a number of staff were accorded international honors and awards for their scholarship.  These awards were representative of the excellent research culture to be found in each of the faculties and research institutes housed on the Mona Campus. Climate scientist, Professor Michael Taylor, Dean of the Faculty of Science and Technology, was the recipient of the 2019 Anthony N. Sabga Caribbean Award for Excellence in Science and Technology. Professor Matthew Smith, Department of History and Archaeology received a prestigious research Fellowship at the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle, North Carolina for the academic year 2018/2019.  Dr. Leith Dunn, Head of the Institute for Gender and Development Studies, was named among the top 100 most influential persons globally in the areas of Gender Policy and Equality for 2019 – the only Caribbean person included on this year’s list. Dr. Tracy Robinson, Senior Lecturer and Deputy Dean, Graduate Studies and Research, Faculty of Law, was the recipient of the 2019 Prominent Woman in International Law (PWIL), an Award given by the American Society of International Law (ASIL). The senior lecturer was recognized for advancing issues of gender and sexuality through her employment of human rights and international law. 

Mr. Lindon Falconer, Head of Programme for Electronics & Electrical Power, Faculty of Engineering, placed first in the category of Engineering and Manufacturing at the National Innovation Competition held on November 21, 2018.   He appeared in the Jamaica Observer on January 21, 2019, the Jamaica Gleaner on January 22, 2019, and in an article published by the  Jamaica Information Service (JIS) about the Award he received.  The articles highlighted his contribution to science and technology in bringing a new electronic security product, the Falcon B4, to the market. The Falcon B4 is a low-cost GSM Alarm and Monitoring System. It enables the use of a mobile phone to control electronic gates, lights, or any electrical appliance that requires on/off control. The control can be done from anywhere in the world, once there is a connection to a mobile network. The system sends out an alert when there is a breach in security. The system is currently available for purchase online. 

Professor Michael Boyne and Dr. Tamara Thompson from the Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, participated in the Royal Society’s Caribbean Frontiers of Science meeting, in 2019. This lead to a follow-on grant proposal with collaborators at the University of Cambridge on the “Prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in high risk women in Kingston, Jamaica, and association with pregnancy outcomes”.

While this Report has selected some scholars to highlight in this section, the examples do not do full justice to the full cadre of researchers who are seriously committed to path breaking research alongside graduate students or in research groups. The Mona Campus is cognizant of the contributions they collectively make to the research reputation of the University. 
$$

Research Advocacy: Contributions to Sustainable Development and the Environment 
$$
The natural environment has taken center stage in the geo-political arena. It is a feature of both the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Vision 2030 Jamaica National Development Plan. Understanding the fragile nature of the environment and the threat of climate change, UWI researchers sought to tackle some of the most pressing problems facing the region.  Central among these was the contribution of UWI, Mona academics to a global report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Contributors to the Special Report on Climate Change And Land were Dr. Adrian Spence of the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences, Dr. Donovan Campbell of the Department of Geography and Geology, Professor Noureddine Benkeblia of the Department of Life Sciences, and Professor Michael Taylor and Dr. Tannecia Stephenson of the Faculty of Science and Technology. The Report highlighted the effects of climate change on oceans – increase in acidity, decline in oxygen levels, rising sea levels, and ocean warming and ice–melting of permafrost. Findings of the Report were also used to inform a special Summary for Policymakers. 

During 2018/2019, a multidisciplinary team from the Faculty of Science and Technology partnered with the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) to conduct research on the seaweed -  Sargassum. The research examined the possibility of valorising the Sargassum which has a range of potential applications and could be viewed as a resource rather than as a nuisance affecting coastlines.    

In other ground-breaking research on marine litter in Jamaica, researchers from the Centre for Marine Sciences and the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences, were the first to document the concentrations and implications of microplastics in the Kingston Harbour and Jamaica. The study used scientific evidence to support the ban on plastics in Jamaica and to support a global movement to reduce plastic and microplastics everywhere.  The study was published in Science of the Total Environment, a 5.589 impact factor international multi-disciplinary journal published under Elsevier.

In 2019, Principal and Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Mona Campus, Professor Dale Webber, attended a presidential summit in Guam consisting of leaders from eight island colleges and universities.  The purpose of the meeting was to address sustainability issues from the perspective of island states. Each Principal shared his or her unique experiences and actions to address sustainability at their institution. The summit leaders subsequently agreed as a collective to a number of initiatives that  included exchange of faculty, staff and students, and finding indigenous responses to island issues. 

In a world increasingly challenged with diminishing natural resources and devastating effects of global warming and climate change on food security and land for housing and settlement, the Mona Campus renewed its commitment in 2018/2019 to advocacy research that will improve the lives of citizens everywhere.

Research Advocacy: Contribution to Regional Development 
$$
The UWI School of Nursing (UWISON) remained committed to addressing the regional shortage of nurses. One new franchise was successfully implemented in the 2018/2019 academic year at the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Community College.  The School has further plans to expand the franchise offering to the Turks and Caicos Islands.  It is anticipated that this arrangement will be formalized in 2019/2020, yielding one more site from which the Bachelor of Nursing programme can be accessed.

The Mona Library commenced a Library Liaison initiative to respond to key areas in Caribbean development. Liaison Librarians ensured that resources were readily available to faculty to better serve research communities in twelve subject areas: Cultural and Entertainment Industries; Agriculture and Food Security; Behavioural Sciences; Crime, Security and Justice; Integration Studies and the Caribbean Single Market and Economy; Climate Change and Sustainable Development; Natural Hazard Management; Education; Health and Wellness; Gender Justice; Entrepreneurship; and Sports and Sports Management.  The Mona Library continues to play a vital role in facilitating research excellence among faculty and students on the Campus.
$$

Social Advocacy
$$
In addition to tackling issues related to the environment, staff and students undertook research that had important policy implications.  During the year under review, Linguistics students interested in language planning surveyed over one 1,000 persons in sections of Kingston and St. Andrew to ascertain language attitudes to members of the deaf community. The survey findings, which were later made available to government functionaries and other stakeholders in Jamaica, could have far-reaching implications for national language policy formulation, planning, and implementation. 

The Director of the UWI Centre for Disability Studies, Senator Dr. Floyd Morris, made three (3) presentations to groups in Trinidad and Tobago, advocating for persons with disabilities. Two (2) seminars were conducted at the United States Embassy in Port of Spain with leaders of Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and leading policy makers and civil servants in the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. At these two seminars, the Director appealed for a unified approach from NGOs when advocating for persons with disabilities.

In order to address a sensitive topical issue affecting the Jamaican population, members of The UWI Nursing Students’ Association and staff of UWISON presented Uncovering Date Rape: A Hidden Crime as part of the annual Orange Your Day Public Lecture.  Dr. Kadian Walters and Mrs. Cynthia Pitter exposed attendees to stark realities faced by survivors of rape trauma.  The presenters also challenged members of the audience to use their respective platforms to lobby for improved policy frameworks and social change to address factors that contribute to, and sustain, rape trauma in Jamaica.   

A multidisciplinary cross-faculty initiative involving the Faculty of Medical Sciences, the Faculty of Humanities and Education, the Faculty of Social Sciences, and representatives from the Ministry of Health resulted in an important study having policy implications. The study, A national survey of the knowledge, attitudes and prescribing practices of doctors regarding antibiotic resistance in a Caribbean country was published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control. The investigation helped to identify areas that needed to be addressed by medical professionals and helped to guide the development of a few advertisements that were aired.

The Institute for Gender and Development Studies (IGDS) whose vision and mandate stress social advocacy, were involved in a seminal undertaking for the society. The IGDS participated in a Child Protection Compact Partnership between the Government of Jamaica and the Government of the United States of America (CPC Project) to Eliminate Child Labour and Child Trafficking in Jamaica. 

Dr. Leith Dunn completed the background paper for a study initiated by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to improve data on the nature and prevalence of child trafficking in Jamaica. Findings and recommendations are being used to plan the methodology for the prevalence study to be implemented by a team from a US based University.   In addition, Mr. Danny Gordon (PI) and IGDS Mona Unit’s co-investigators Dr. Leith Dunn and Mrs. Carol Watson-Williams,  formulated and submitted the National Action Plan to Reduce Child Labour in Jamaica for the Child Labour Committee in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) in July 2019.  This gender mainstreaming project provided an opportunity to integrate gender perspectives in the situation analysis and the recommendations for the National Action Plan. 

Research advocacy that contributes to social development remains a fixed one on the agenda of the Mona Campus.  The 2018/2019 achievements will be followed up and accelerated in the 2019/2020 period.

partnerships: Strategic Alignment to Improve Teaching and Research Partnerships
$$
Collaborations with other Universities   
Academic/Industry Partnerships    
$$

Introduction PART
$$
A foundational pillar of The UWI Strategic Plan is the objective of alignment which calls for strategic linkages with the public and private sectors.  The University must take a leading role in initiating these partnerships and being an advocate for impactful social change.  The following selected collaborations showcase the intellectual capital of the University and demonstrate that we are fully poised to play a leading role in a wide range of disciplinary development initiatives.    As a research-driven University, a primary goal of the academy is to confront the many challenges facing the region and find solutions through scientific research.  Such solutions are better realized through partnerships which bring both intellectual and financial resources that complement our scholars and students’ expertise. To maximize its current resources, the Mona Campus is building on the model of many successful universities and economies that are founded on shared research and development partnerships to realize efficiencies in production and cost savings through technology. During the year under review the University renewed established alliances and engaged in a number of new strategic alliances. 
$$

Collaborations with other Universities
$$
External recognition of UWI scholars provides some assurance that we are, indeed, becoming an excellent global university rooted in the Caribbean. Efforts to broaden The UWI’s visibility were evident during the previous year when a number of departments formalized agreements with other institutions.  The Department of Literatures in English partnered with a similar department at the University of Maryland, United States, to co-teach two thematically identical courses in the second semester of 2018/2019. Literature and Ideas in the Caribbean was taught at the Mona Campus while Caribbean Literature: Literature and Ideas in the Caribbean was taught at the University of Maryland. Co-teaching these courses led to the sharing of course materials and a cross-fertilization of ideas that were mutually beneficial. 

A collaborative agreement between the Government of Mexico and the Government of Jamaica gave rise to the establishment of a Mexico Chair at The University of the West Indies. Under this agreement, Dr. Rubén Olachea Pérez visited the Faculty of Humanities and Education and gave lectures on various themes to staff and students during October to November 2018. In the words of the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology, “[Dr. Pérez’s] ideas and contributions …  [were] greatly appreciated, especially at a time when our Department is implementing significant changes regarding the content and delivery of our programmes.”  

Faculty of Engineering (FOE) students were able to attend lectures at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) via live stream each Thursday; this is in keeping with an MOU with the University of Pennsylvania. Students are exposed to projects that are not available at the Faculty of Engineering because of the current infrastructure within the Faculty. Students from UPENN visited the Faculty in the 2018/2019 academic year and at the end of the exchange a combined team of students from The UWI Mona, the University of Technology (UTech) and UPENN built a prototype for rehabilitative devices. The next step is for the design and development of devices for the Jamaican market. In addition, the Engineering Faculty entered an Agreement with the University of Florida where students will study at their home and partner institution for the award of a Joint Degree. Students will be afforded the opportunity to pursue Joint Degrees in the following areas: Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Systems Engineering and Aerospace Engineering.  The first set of students will depart for the University of Florida in the 2020/2021 academic year.  

The Office of Student Services and Development (OSSD) continues to enhance the global presence of The University of the West Indies through the two Short-term Exchange Programmes coordinated by the Office was arranged under The Memoranda of Understanding for both programmes signed in 1995. The Short-term Exchange Programmes are delivered as formal agreements between The University of the West Indies (UWI, Mona) and Florida State University (FSU) and the University of Costa Rica (UCR).  

Under the MOU, twelve (12) students and two (2) members of staff from The UWI, Mona visit FSU in October of each year and an equal number of staff and students from FSU, visit The UWI, Mona, in March. Similarly, twelve (12) students and two (2) members of staff from The UWI, Mona visit the UCR in May of each year and an equal number of staff and students from the UCR, visit The UWI, Mona, in January. The Programme has been in existence since the 1995/1996 academic year.

In June 2019 a Dendrochronology Laboratory was established in the Department of Geography and Geology to enhance capacity in Paleoclimatology. The lab was established in collaboration with researchers in Amsterdam and at the University of Nevada, Reno and funded by a National Geographic Grant. 

Based on an Agreement with the Global Institute of Software Engineering (GIST) in China, the first 18-member cohort of the BSc in Software Engineering UWI-CIIT programme, left for China on September 4, 2018.  Under the Agreement, UWI students complete the first (2) two years at The UWI and the last (2) two years in China.  As part of the programme, students complete a six-month paid internship at an IT company in the Suzhou Industrial Park.  Graduating students receive a diploma from GIST and a Bachelor’s degree from The UWI.

In alignment with the objectives of the 2017-2022 Strategic Plan with respect to international partnerships, the International Students Office (ISO), UWI Mona, renewed the following Agreements that have been converted into active partnerships for The UWI Mona. These are: 

1. University of Western Ontario – Canada
2. University of Toronto – Canada
3. Santo Domingo Institute of Technology (INTEC) – Dominican Republic
4. Ryerson University – Canada
5. University of Valladolid – Spain
6. University of Gothenburg – Sweden
7. University of Guelph – Canada
8. University of New Brunswick – Canada
9. Brock University - Canada
10. Dokkyo University – Japan

Under these Agreements, students at The UWI are exposed to various student exchange opportunities in areas such as Chemistry, Social Work, and Marine Sciences.  The Agreement with Brock University forms part of the new initiative by the Vice Chancellor to establish the Canada-Caribbean Institute. The purpose of the Institute is to provide a focal point for multi-disciplinary research and teaching to deepen and improve the multi-faceted relationships between Canada and the Caribbean and examine issues affecting the Caribbean diaspora communities in Canada.

The ISO also successfully negotiated new partnerships with four (4) Universities:
1. University of Salzburg – Austria
2. University of Magdalena – Colombia
3. Cottey College – USA
4. McEwan University – Canada

These efforts at international collaboration are crucial for UWI’s development as a research enterprise and for attracting more students from outside the Caribbean region.
$$

Academic/Industry Partnerships
$$
During the previous academic year, the Mona Campus continued efforts to increase access to products and services for the public and private sectors.  This synergy is crucial for the continued exchange of ideas and for collectively solving problems that face the country and the region. The MSBM signed an MOU with the Human Resource Management Association of Jamaica (HRMAJ). The two entities plan to collaborate on certification of professional developmental courses, which are aligned to internationally recognized standards. It is hoped that this collaboration will lead to further research in human resource management. 

Ongoing discussions and collaboration between the Jamaica National (JN) Bank and the Mona Library since 2016 were also formalized in July 2019 with JN accepting the “Executive Research Access” proposal which will provide research services and resources of the Mona Library to 12 JN Group Executives for an annual fee of JMD$ 1 milion. This successful partnership aligns not only with core value of “collaboration” of the Mona Library but more importantly with a key objective of The UWI Triple A Strategy to increase and improve academic/industry research partnerships.    

Within the Faculty of Social Sciences, Social Work students collaborated with the National Housing Trust to assist with community research and project development in NHT communities.  

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Bureau of Standards Jamaica (BSJ) and the Alternative Energy Research Group (AERG), Department of Physics. Under the MOU the AERG will assist the BSJ in the development and execution of a plan to reduce energy consumption at BSJ locations in Kingston, Montego Bay, Mandeville, Ocho Rios and Savanna-la-Mar. Memorandum of Understandings were signed between the Centre for Marine Sciences, and the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) for the UWI-CMS/DBML to assess the current status of the Winn’s Morass mangrove stand in Trelawny and its potential for rehabilitation; as well as with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries’- Fisheries Division to facilitate the completion of the 2018 Queen Conch Abundance Surveys. 

The UWI Libraries collaborated with the Jamaica Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) towards (i) the setting up of an IP Desk in the Mona Library as requested by Pro Vice-Chancellor for Graduate Studies and Research, Professor Stephan Gift and (ii) setting up of a Technical Innovation Support Centre (TISC) at UWI Mona. Towards this end, members of the Library staff were awarded scholarships to pursue IP Training courses via the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). 

In July 2019, Principal Dale Webber and Dr. Courtney Hogarth, Director of the Confucius Institute in Jamaica, visited the Taiyuan University of Technology (TYUT) in China. This was in response to an invitation extended by Dr. Feng Lei, the Chinese Director appointed to the Confucius Institute at Mona.  Principal Webber had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Wu Yucheng, Chair of the Council of Taiyuan University of Technology, Huang Qingxue, President of TYUT, and several representatives from TYUT. Several matters were discussed relating to the 10t anniversary of the CI at Mona that included: the Second Caribbean Confucius Institutes Regional Meeting to be hosted by Mona in mid-October; future staff and student exchanges; and collaboration on the operations of the Confucius Institute. A brief ceremony was also held to confer on Professor Webber the title of Honorary Professor to the TYUT; and on Dr. Hogarth, the title of Visiting Professor, TYUT College of Art. They were both presented official documents by President Huang Qingxue.

Realizing Cost Savings
$$
In an era of fiscal restraint and reduced government funding, the long-term viability of The UWI  can no longer rely solely on subventions and tuition fees to fund its operations. We  have accelerated our strategic partnerships with local, regional, and international agencies,  and continued with the recent past initiatives in refining the new business model. This agile thinking has informed the efforts made in 2018/2019 to improve our financial health.

Financial gains are earned by a reduction in expenditures. All departments were urged to consider ways in which they would reduce costs to the budget and create more savings. SALISES was able to reduce spending by purchasing airline tickets directly online, reviewing and streaming existing service contracts for cost effectiveness and potential by engaging students during the summer to replace staff on leave. CARIMAC reduced hospitality costs by placing vending machines in the Main Building and Annex 2. Moving to a paperless system, they also reduced printing costs by digitizing the annual CARIMAC Times magazine and using QR Scan codes for orientation and other material. The CARIMAC Times (now CARIMAC Digitimes) and orientation material are now available electronically. CARIMAC also reduced expenditures in advertising in print media by promoting programmes and short courses by exploiting social media such as Facebook and Instagram. Social media is one of the primary ways in which information flows are now received and circulated.
$$

Diversifying the Revenue Base
$$
During the previous academic year, The UWI made strides in becoming an income-generating enterprise. In October of 2018, a number of labs received accreditation status inclusive of the Chemical Pathology, Haematology, Cytology and Flow Cytometry Laboratories. Accreditation will assist in attracting international research grants and participation in clinical trials. Mrs. Sandra Hing, a Molecular Geneticist from the United Kingdom, offered instruction on new techniques at the Cytogenetics Laboratory in the Department of Pathology. These techniques will result in increased clinical service and income generation and will enable staff to undertake more impactful research. 

In an effort to commercialize research, the Dermatology Group, within the Department of Medicine, began a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a novel cream, Keloflat,® in the treatment of pathologic scarring.  If successful, the product will  yield benefits for the University’s reputation and  its economic health.

During the previous academic year, the Mona Geoinformatics Institute (MGI) continued to diversify its operations, with an increasing number of projects in the Eastern Caribbean. These included an additional sixteen (16) projects across six (6) countries, with partners comprising IMC Inc., Goldsmiths College, University of South Hampshire and University of York (all UK); as well as DE Design+Environment (Canada). Target beneficiaries of these grants include the governments of Antigua, Guyana, British Virgin Islands, Saint Lucia, Jamaica and Dominica; and the Eastern Caribbean States as a sub-region.  New projects since 2018   will yield a total revenue of USD$ 2.6 million over the next few years. These projects all address critical regional and global issues related to climate change, applying GIS modeling capabilities to effect practical and policy 

solutions across different sectors of host countries’ societies. Providing access to technology, data and information and gaining revenues are pivotal outcomes of these projects with the added advantage of generating empirical evidence that allows for the generation of suitable policies. 

The Mona Library primarily through the Reprographic Services Unit (RESU), and rental from its Multifunctional Room, generated income for the Library and the Campus. The year under review saw RESU generating a profit of JMD$ 9,510,701.27 an increase of over two (2) million dollars compared to last year.  Income generated by the Multifunctional Room showed a slight increase, which allowed for necessary renovations to be carried out during the year. 

Two (2) other examples of our diversification attempts are useful in demonstrating how the Mona Campus has sought to commercialize services for income generation. The Energy Management Unit within Mona Tech Engineering Services submitted a proposal to the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica for bulb crushing services to government buildings island wide. The focus of the project is on removing mercury from fluorescent bulbs before disposing the glass and other fragments; the mercury will be safely stored and eventually shipped overseas in accordance with international guidelines. The proposal was accepted and is expected to bring in revenue of JMD$ 16 million. 

The Human Resource Development Unit within the Department of Sociology, Psychology and Social Work developed a consultancy to market its courseware and psychometric testing services; The UWI’s legal team is currently advising on how best to preserve our patents on the open market for this new set of services being offered by The UWI. 
$$

The Business Development Office 
$$
For the 2018/2019 academic year, the Business Development Office (BDO) undertook several projects related to the core functions of the BDO. These included increasing the revenue base of the University; providing financial assistance to deserving students through third-party partnerships; and enhancing and promoting The UWI brand through tours and partnerships. The BDO generated revenues of nearly JMD$ 80 million over the 2018/2019 reporting period.
$$

Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)
$$
Recognizing the importance of Public Private Partnerships to the financial health of the Campus, the Mona Campus in 2018 formally established a PPP Unit to manage and provide necessary oversight to the development, implementation, management and operation of relevant contractual agreements at the Mona Campus. The role of the PPP Unit also extends beyond the management of the agreements, to the maintenance of good stakeholder relations with the various private partners, Campus entities and vendors involved with the operation of PPPs. 

The PPP Unit comprises General Management, Technical, Financial and Legal expertise, all of which are deemed to be critical areas of focus in PPP management. This structure was established in keeping with international best practices for the establishment of PPP Units.  Additional administrative staff will be brought in to further streamline and strengthen PPP communication, record keeping, and operations.
$$

Student Housing Project-Partner: 138 Students Living Limited
$$
138 Students Living Limited operates three (3) of eleven (11) Halls of residence at the Mona Campus, namely; Irvine, Leslie Robinson and George Alleyne Halls (138 Halls) through PPP agreements established with the Campus in 2014 and 2015. While there were some challenges in meeting near full user capacity in the first years, in more recent times we have been able to achieve the guaranteed occupancy level during the first and second semesters of each academic year. 

The PPP was also plagued with a number of unresolved financial matters; under the current administration unresolved financial issues as at July 2018 were settled resulting in a net receivable for the Campus. The review of academic year 2018/2019 is underway and is expected to also result in a net receivable for the Campus. 

The quality of the services offered to students by 138 SL have also improved which is evidenced in the reduction of complaints being submitted to the Campus. Campus offices and 138 partners have become more willing to work together to resolve issues when they arise. A good foundation has been established to further improve the partnership which will assist the Campus in realizing its expected benefits.  As the project matures, the benefits to the Campus are expected to increase. 
$$

Cogen Project – Partner: Pelican Power Limited
$$
The University of the West Indies, Mona Campus (UWI Mona), has a student population of almost 19,000 and growing and a staff complement in excess of 3,000. The UWI Mona currently consumes approximately six (6) Megawatts (MW) of electricity at its peak during the day and a base load of approximately three (3) MW at night. This makes UWI Mona one of the largest consumers of electricity in the country, with an annual bill at the beginning of 2019 of some JMD$ 819,625,135.15. Significantly, this power cost came during a period of relatively low global oil prices, which kept the price of power purchased from Jamaica Public Service (JPS) relatively low. 

In the recent past, the Mona Campus has received monthly billings from JPS as high as JMD$ 84,000,000. Against this background UWI Mona is working on becoming an energy self-generator by constructing a power plant and connecting it to existing heat absorption chillers now on Campus, thereby establishing a co-generation plant for its own use. The project commenced in 2018 and is set for completion during the second quarter 2020. At that time the Campus should see a net reduction of over JMD$ 160 Million per year in its charges for energy, thus reducing this  financial operating overhead  considerably. 

The project also presents unique training opportunities for UWI Mona Engineering students in the operation and maintenance of dual fuel medium speed reciprocating engine technology. This will benefit Engineering graduates by providing them with hands-on experience and practical understanding of combined heat and power (CHP) plant technology in the region. In addition, real life practical experience in the skillful management of multiple fuel economics and procurement practices will be invaluable to students. They will graduate into an environment in which those skillsets will position them as both engineers and power plant developers setting out to confront the country’s and the region’s power development challenges.

The project also creates multiple partnership opportunities for the Campus. General Electric and Marinsa Caribbean Co. Ltd. with the Campus’ agreement, intends to showcase the Plant to their potential partners as a model for developing similar projects within the region.

Water Supply- Partner: North Star Development (Water) Jamaica Limited 
$$
In December 2016 the Campus commissioned its own well water source and supply system. The change in the source of the supply resulted in water distribution challenges across the Campus, most of which were rectified by January 2018. A flow management protocol has been implemented to maintain the supply to the Campus during critical operational periods. Despite the occurrence of occasional disruptions, the reliability of the system has significantly improved during off peak periods. 

Despite the occurrence of occasional disruptions, the reliability of the system has significantly improved during off peak periods. During peak period the Campus implements a flow management protocol to maintain the supply to the Campus during critical operational periods.  

Both the University and its partner agree that supply volumes need to be augmented during peak periods to further improve the performance of the supply system; work is underway to establish a second Well to facilitate the delivery of the additional flows to the Campus.
$$

From the Plant’s commissioning to date, the project has saved the Campus more than JMD$ 500 million (i.e. on average JMD$ 15 million/month). Other benefits to the Campus include: 
$$
An improved level of communication between the Campus and its utility provider;
Timely response times from system technicians;
The sustained availability of good quality water for the Campus, and; 
The availability of water to the Campus during periods of drought.
$$

Our Financial Status 
$$
The UWI is a JMD$18 billion operation. Only 40% of income is derived from government contributions, a reduction of  80% in the 2008 academic year. Twenty percent (20%) is derived from tuition fees which leaves the Campus with the responsibility of trying to close the 40% gap, which it does through its commercial operations. While the student population has increased marginally, it is the renewal of the fee collection policy prior to registration which can be reported as a successful intervention strategy for 2018/2019 with 93% student compliance - up from 81% in the previous academic year. We thank the Mona Guild of Students for their leadership and oversight of the process. Further increases in physical student numbers is unlikely because of capacity limitations in places on the Campus, but online options offer renewed optimism. 

Containment initiatives resulted in a positive balance which was however eroded by post-employment benefits; this resulted in total comprehensive loss for the Campus. 
$$

Student Enrolment 
$$
Student enrolment climbed at an annualized rate of 3% over the five (5) years to 2019. Physical capacity constraints dictate that we prioritise strategies to move more programmes on-line. This will ease the pressure on aging plant and actually improve the financial viability of  such programmes as on-line delivery is less costly.
$$

Net revenue 
$$
Revenue growth has been a cause for concern. Government subvention has been increasing at a rate of 5.8% annually over the last five (5) years while overall revenue has grown at a rate of 3.9%. This is troubling since it is happening in the context of declining support from the governments in real terms. It has been our intent to grow revenues significantly from other sources so that we would be far less dependent on subventions and more so on tuition fees and commercial operations. The graph shows that since the closure of the Sutherland Call Centre (a commercial operation) early in the 2017 financial year, we have not been able to find a JMD$1 billion replacement for that lost stream of income. We are fully aware that our efforts to find and grow significant commercial sources of income must intensify.
$$

Total Comprehensive Loss
$$
For the first time in the last five (5) years, The UWI has had to post net loss before Pension and Post-employment benefits. The sharp decline in bottom line performance this year is a combination of flat revenue (it grew by less than JMD$ 200 million) and a ballooning wage bill arising from signed union agreements. The increases from staff costs (including accruals for pension and post-employment benefits) amounted to well over JMD$1 billion. To reverse this unsustainable trend, measures will be pursued in 2019/2020 to reduce or hold steady operating costs in five major areas. Furthermore, until and unless there are surpluses from non-core businesses that can subsidize the cost of operating the Campus, tuition fees will have to be increased annually by at least the rate of inflation.

Mobilizing Human Resources: Radical Collaboration
$$
In support of The UWI 2017–2022 Strategic Plan to develop a “creative, caring, accountable, motivated and professional staff”, the Mona Campus included Radical Collaboration as one of its priority strategies for maximizing resources for a sustainable future. Through this, we hope to expose hundreds of staff to the skills necessary to build a collaborative environment at the Campus. Radical Collaboration is an approach to building and maintaining climates of trust and collaboration within organizations. The skills focus on  building lasting collaborative relationships by minimizing conflicts.  Widely used in a range of applications in both public and private sectors worldwide, including universities, the Radical Collaboration approach is proven to increase productivity, efficiency and staff engagement.

Our human resources at the Mona Campus are our greatest asset.  We know that people can make or break an organization. Inspired, driven and motivated employees work harder and with more commitment to the collective good of the organization. The cumulative effect of increased efforts from a significant percentage of employees shows up immediately in the vastly improved quality of outputs and services.  The Radical Collaboration model provides the necessary support to ensure loyal and motivated employees. During the 2018/2019 academic year a total of 132 persons were trained in Radical Collaboration including the Senior Management team and senior members of Faculties and Administrative Units. The programme is focused primarily on skill building and helps participants:  

Build collaborative skills   
Build and maintain long-term climates of trust   
Develop and solidify partnerships and alliances   
Learn about the dynamics of interpersonal relationships
Practice problem solving in simulated and real-time situations       
Gain personal insight into attitudes and behaviours in conflicted situations

This initiative will continue in the new academic year 2019/2020 with a strategy being developed to sustain the momentum of trained staff.  The model thrives on the spill on effect of trainings, such that those who are trained will keep training others on the job. New persons will also be recommended for certification as Radical Collaboration Trainers, departments will be earmarked for staff training, with agreed timelines for certification training and the numbers per certification programme.  
$$

Dr Tomlin Paul
$$
The effectiveness of our strategies and interventions at the Mona Campus will depend not only on the availability of funds for their support but a critical factor for success is the ability of all members of our Campus community to work together. Investing in collaboration will bring big returns for the campus in ensuring the success of all of our strategic initiatives and in the long run we should see greater productivity. Having bad training in Radical Collaboration, supported by our Campus, I am happy to see the value of this training in my day to day work as Dean of a large and complex Faculty. I am confident that the further enhancement of our Campus culture through training in Radical Collaboration will be a game changer for us at Mona.

Staff Members Completing Degree Programmes at UWI    
$$
The UWI provides the facility for staff to access most programmes delivered at The UWI without having to bear the cost of tuition. Many staff members access this benefit and in the 2018/2019, 15% of our staff were enrolled in programmes being offered at the Mona Campus. 
$$

UWI Gender Mainstreaming
$$
The UWI continued in its efforts to promote a culture of gender equity and equality. Since the establishment of The UWI Gender Policy in 2017, the Institute of Gender and Development Studies has spearheaded several initiatives geared at creating a gender equity footprint across the Campus. These are engrained in policies and programmes that directly influence our students and staff: Gender Focal Points have been nominated in each Faculty; Gender Sensitization Sessions were organized and presented to various stakeholders across the Campus; and Gender Action Plans are being developed for each Faculty.

The UWI Mona's commitment to Gender Mainstreaming since 2012/2013 has also been strengthened by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030 (SDGs). These include Gender Equality (Goal 5), Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10), and the recognition of gender as essential to achieving all 17 SDGs. The SDGs provide entry points to integrate gender in ALL UWI faculties and departments. It also aligns with the Gender Sector Plan for Jamaica's Vision 2030 National Development Agenda. 
$$

The UWI Western Jamaica Campus
$$
At the Western Jamaica Campus, all members of the Facilities Management Unit (FMU) – office attendants, lab attendants, grounds persons and gardeners – were exposed to on-site training in cleaning, landscaping, and safety in the workplace. These sessions were led by established external facilitators. Among support staff, one member is pursuing an Associate Degree while another is pursuing a Diploma in Education, while others are actively involved in professional and civic associations and community outreach programmes.

Enhancing Operational Efficiencies
$$
During the previous academic year, a number of initiatives contributed to increased operational efficiencies.  In consultation with the Office of Student Services and Development, the Estate Management Department (EMD) developed water management strategies, particularly for the Halls of Residence. In addition, the EMD is collaborating with the Marketing, Recruitment and Communications Office to roll out an environmental awareness initiative across the Campus to ensure both responsiveness to the SDGs as well as financial savings on unnecessary wastage.

Members of the Finance and General Purposes Committee approved the adoption of The Maintenance Authority Computerized Maintenance Management System (TMA-CMMS) across the Campus. The System allows for effective tracking of assets at the Department and Faculty levels and management of the Campus’ maintenance costs.

The Estate Management Department adopted REDCap® software for more efficient tracking of rental information as well as for tracking the movement and status of documents within the EMD and between the EMD and the Bursary.  The software was created at Vanderbilt University and is free to use for any type of data collection activity that is entirely maintained and supported by each institution. The software, which resides with Mona Information Technology Services (MITS), can be used by departments and staff at Mona.

To improve the turn-around time for requested information and customer service, the automation and production of Status Letters, which are requested by students, were achieved in the Student Affairs section of the Admissions Office.  Automation has greatly reduced the time to process Status Letters and reduced the risk of human error.  Students are now able to initiate requests through the click of a button and complete payment in person or online.  The process has also reduced the workload of staff allowing them to redirect their activities on other areas also requiring improved efficiencies in our customer service. 

Throughout the academic year the Library continued an aggressive weeding out of printed materials that registered low circulation for which digital surrogates were available. Weeding is necessary to transform Library areas to accommodate the demand by undergraduate students for more collaborative spaces. This is also a part of The Library’s strategic initiative to foster student innovation and creativity.

The UWI Mona Library was also awarded an Elton B. Stephens Company (EBSCO) Solar Grant of USD$ 100,000 to implement a 46.86kWdc Solar Photovoltaic System on the roofs of the Science & Engineering Branch Library (SEBL) and the Physics Lab. The UWI, Mona is the first university outside the United States to win the EBSCO Solar Grant.   These solar panels were successfully installed on the Science and Engineering Branch Library and the Department of Physics and became operational in February 2019. A visit and tour by a team from EBSCO was carried out in March 2019. 
$$

Digitization Initiatives
$$
Digitization was identified as one of the priority strategies for transforming processes used in administration and in the primary services we offer of teaching and communication of knowledge products. Digital technology represents a powerful tool for widening access to a UWI education, reducing expenditure on capital projects, and developing products for commercialization.  During the year under review a number of departments used digital technology to generate gains.  For example, to improve learning outcomes, several instructors in the Department of Computing recorded their lectures and posted the videos on OurVLE, the University’s course management system. The recorded videos not only enhance student learning but also have the potential of attracting regional and part-time students to the Department’s programmes.

In the Office of the Campus Registrar, staff from the Student Affairs section teamed up with MITS to develop an automated ranking system of entry qualifications from student applications to the Faculty of Humanities and Education. The automation would not only bring the Faculty in line with  what obtained in other Faculties, but would also considerably diminish the time and resources  deployed in the processing of applications. As a result of this initiative, the number of offers for the Faculty at January 31, 2019 increased by 30%, no doubt as a result of the shift from the manual process which previously existed.

The Digitization Project, which is overseen by the Campus Records Office in the Office of the Campus Registrar, expanded in 2011 to include the conversion of all student files to digital format. Digitization has saved approximately JMD$ 1.5 million annually on file jackets and other filing supplies.

More importantly, the electronic system allows for easy access and fast retrieval of information when used in conjunction with the Banner Student System. To date, approximately 530,000 pages of documents for students who commenced in the academic year 2010/2011 to present is now available in Banner Document Management System.  This effort has served to establish the viability of a central electronic document management service for the University’s administrative functions.
$$

Digital Transformation
$$
MITS is charged with realizing a vision of a digitally transformed University that markedly improves the student experience and student outcomes. Digitally transforming teaching and learning is fundamental to the University’s mission. This transformation also includes the creation of new technology enabled business models, particularly in the context of contracting public sector funding and increased competition in the higher education space. While the transformation requires continuous innovation of capabilities and approaches to administrative processes, teaching, learning, and research, the year 2018/2019 saw a refocusing and rationalization of our resources and potential for achieving gains.

The work of MITS over the last year has focused on the ICT infrastructure necessary to support digital transformation, and laying the platform for digital transformation initiatives, specifically to

Create a highly connected Campus
Enhance teaching and learning spaces
Improve and expand online education and e-learning
Implement technology to support research and innovation (Research Computing)
Improve administrative efficiency and the student experience
$$

Creating a highly connected Campus
$$
Ubiquitous, high performance network (and Internet) connectivity is fundamental to a technology enabled Campus and digital transformation. The recent focus has been on improving wireless Internet services to students on the Halls of Residence. A new wireless (Wi-Fi) network was implemented for (the new) Irvine Hall providing wireless Internet services to all residential and common areas of the Hall. This is the latest in a broader initiative to continuously improve wireless (Wi-Fi) services across the Campus which has resulted in a more than doubling of wireless service capacity Campus-wide and new wireless networks commissioned on the ABC, Chancellor, Preston, Rex Nettleford, and Taylor Halls and the upgrade on wireless infrastructure of all Faculties. 
$$

Enhancing  teaching and learning spaces
$$
The need to implement more student-centered, flexible and interactive approaches to learning requires re-engineering of existing learning spaces. In part this can be supported by multimedia and Internet collaboration and streaming technologies.  An additional four (4) teaching spaces were equipped with multimedia and videoconferencing systems. Currently, one hundred and sixty (160) instructional spaces (at Mona and the Western Jamaica Campus) are equipped with multimedia infrastructure.
$$

Improvement  and expansion of  online education and e-learning
$$
MITS has implemented technologies critical to the support of online and blended learning. These include learning management systems (LMS), virtual learning environments (VLE) and interactive response systems. An objective is to accelerate the move of teaching and learning online.  In this regard, the number of active online course environments have increased by 26% over the prior year. This resulted in the number of courses with an online component increasing from approximately 2300 to a current total of 2,892. In addition, MITS developed and delivered staff (faculty) training – some aspects in collaboration with CETL – in the effective use of the virtual learning environment and learning management systems, and collaborative learning platforms that include the following: 

Basic training for staff members and all new academic staff members prior to the start of each academic year and upon request thereafter.
Interactive classroom response systems.
Intermediate and advanced training for all staff members at the start of each semester.
Tailored on demand training with groups or individuals as needed.
Computer based training and self-help resources online.
Access to a catalogue of self-service video resources offering step-by-step guidance to tutors in accomplishing common tasks within the Virtual Learning Environment.
Virtual training using online tools such as Blackboard Collaborate and Zoom video conferencing.

$$

Research Computing Implementing technology to support research and innovation
$$
Research computing, that is, the use of high-performance computers to support and solve problems that are computationally and data intensive, is necessary for many contemporary areas of basic and applied research. MITS successfully manages a high-performance computing cluster (HPCC) in support of research and innovation and   prioritizes supporting this resource to faculty to diversify the range of research areas that might benefit. During the last year MITS management of high-performance computers has served as a resource for scientific modelling, numerical computation and (big) data analytics in support of the following research areas:

Climate Change, Climate Risk Assessment and Climate Resilience
Material Science Studies
Post-fire Characterization
Environmental Modelling
$$

Improving administrative efficiency and the student experience
$$
Informed decision-making increases administrative efficiency and effectiveness and is a critical prerequisite for digital business agility and consequently, digital transformation. In the last year specific administrative and academic processes have been targeted for improvement, automation and analytics to better support and drive a culture of data driven decision-making included initiatives in the following:

Improving the student experience
Improving workforce management
Improving the management of the physical plant (facilities management)
Improving financial management 

The objective is to have  similar and other related initiatives lay the platform for digital transformation of the Campus in the coming years.

Dr. Barbara Carby, Director of the Disaster Risk Reduction Centre (DRRC) and Dr. David Smith, Coordinator ISD, are the Principal Investigators for the Enhancing Knowledge and Application of Comprehensive Disaster Management (EKACDM) project funded by a CDN$ 2.7 million grant from the Government of Canada through Global Affairs Canada.  The EKACDM Initiative is a five-year project whose Ultimate Outcome is the implementation of the CARICOM Enhanced Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM) Framework (2007) to reduce the impacts of natural and technological hazards, and the effect mechanism and programme to manage knowledge in CDM, which is Priority Outcome 2 of the CDM Strategy of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA). The Initiative had three key outcomes:

An enhanced regional network that generates, manages and shares knowledge on CDM and that includes gender issues.
Increased use of standardized gender-sensitive educational and training materials for CDM by professionals and students in the Caribbean.
An enhanced mainstreaming of gender-sensitive decision-making for CDM in the public and private sectors, in particular SMEs.

The project was successfully completed in December 2018 and produced very commendable outcomes, including: online graduate courses on Disaster Risk Management; training on business continuity and developing business plans for small business owners; postgraduate research scholarships; software development; staff and student exchanges; the development of guidelines and policy frameworks to reduce disaster risk for Tourism and Agriculture, and; training for  SMEs in the tourism, and agriculture sectors and the private sector to increase resilience to disasters.

$$

Collaborations in Teaching and Research
$$
Fueled by its mission to undertake high-impact research and excellent graduate teaching, The Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies (SALISES) entered into four (4) Memoranda of Understanding aimed at pursuing collaboration in teaching and research. The agreements were formalized with the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex, United Kingdom; the University of Prince Edward Island (The Institute of Island Studies) in Canada; Humber College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning in Canada; and the Universität Kassel in Germany.  One of the initiatives under the MOU between SALISES and Humber College is to foster student exchange between these institutions. To this end, SALISES hosted sixteen (16) Humber College students for two (2) weeks in May 2019. During their stay, the students were briefed on Jamaica’s criminal justice system. Arising from the MOU with the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI), Dr. Dacia Leslie, Research Fellow (SALISES), was granted a Canada-CARICOM Leadership Scholarship to conduct research work at UPEI for five (5) months.

The employment of a Grants Writer at SALISES resulted in an increase in the number of consultancies that the Institute provided. Consultancy services were provided to Winrock International Jamaica, the EU-LAC Foundation, the United Nations Development Programme, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and the Urban Development Corporation. Policy orientated consultancies included the completion of a Horizon Scanning and Foresighting Study for Jamaica’s Third City (sponsored by the UDC).  SALISES was also contracted to design and implement protection and prevention activities to address child trafficking in Jamaica. This contract was in support of a Child Protection Compact Partnership signed between the United States Department of State and the Government of Jamaica.

The UWI-Belgium Connection
$$
The Office of the Principal hosted a Cocktail Reception on July 11, 2019, to commemorate the 40thanniversary staging of two Murals which were donated to The UWI Mona Campus by Belgian artist, Mr. Claude Rahir. The Reception was a joint effort between The UWI, Mona and His Excellency Guy Servin, Ambassador of Belgium to Jamaica, (through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade). 

The imposing and colourful murals are immediately recognizable  landmarks  fronting two buildings of the Campus and a daily reminder that we do not live by bread alone. They chant a mantra for social change and are reflective of values that are dear to the heart of The UWI.  One Mural Communication demonstrates the artist’s commitment to the ideals of peace and love between nations and is aptly displayed on the walls of the Caribbean Institute of Media and Communication (CARIMAC). The Mural depicts communication of every kind – overhead hovers a communication satellite, while down on earth people listen to transistor radios, kiss, play musical instruments, and women play with and nurse babies. The Mural was completed in 1979. 

Another Mural serves as a striking introduction to the Main Administrative Complex of the Mona Campus. Familiarly called the Year of the Child Mural, it depicts the activities of the seven Faculties of The University of the West Indies, as well as children at work and play, commemorating the International Year of the Child, 1979, in which it too was executed.

The GATTFEST Film Festival
$$
The Centre for Tourism and Policy Research (CTPR) hosted the seventh staging of the GATFFEST Film Festival in June 2019. For the 2019 staging of the festival, 51 films were submitted from a total of 20 countries. The festival also boasted an expansion from 8 to 10 days, with the most collaborations with embassies and partners to date.  The GATFFEST Film festival has quickly grown to be the largest film festival in Jamaica, one of the largest film festivals in the Caribbean, as well as one of the longest running film festivals in Jamaica after celebrating its seventh staging in June 2019.  Over the years GATTFEST has received ongoing support from the Japanese, Mexican, South African and Colombian embassies; during GATFFEST 2018, the CTPR was approached by many potential partners including the Embassy of Mexico, The Republic of Korea and the Embassy of Cuba to partner to co-host their own GATFFEST film nights in June 2019. A new award, the “Archie”, in recognition of and named after the former Mona Campus Principal, Professor Archibald McDonald, was also unveiled at the staging of this years’ event. 

CARIMAC and Frame of Reference, a Post Production facility in Kingston, hosted Film Rush, an annual film workshop held on March 8 to 10, 2019 at CARIMAC Annex II.  This activity exposed high school students to different areas of film production.  Filmmaker, Mr. Gerald Hynes, conducted a workshop for the participants on Friday, March 8 after which the teams wrote, shot and edited their films. A screening and an award ceremony were held on Sunday, March 10.  CARIMAC also hosted the KingstOOn 2019 animation forum in conjunction with the World Bank’s Youth Employment in the Digital and Animation Industry (YEDAI) project at the University of Technology, Jamaica. The School contributed by awarding scholarships for the categories of Best Storyboard, Best Character Design, Best Caribbean Short Film, Best Concept, Best Student Film, and the Best Performance in the Pitch Development Boot Camp Competition.  The winners were given the opportunity to pursue a CARIMAC Summer Short Course. Faculty also attended the event to improve their delivery and understanding of the international animation industry.  Through this event, CARIMAC was able to establish relationships with Animation Lounge and Raquel Benitez of Centennial College in Toronto, Canada. Benitez also owns and operates Comet Entertainment Inc.  and is willing to lecture for a few weeks on her expertise in producing animation projects to CARIMAC students.  Still in the field of media studies, in April 2019, the top two documentaries produced by Journalism students were presented to an audience of media practitioners, business people, and students.  The documentaries titled, Long Live Free Grenada and Rasta Revelation, produced by Trellona Charles and Kemeisha Ellis, respectively, were well received and the students were commended for their efforts.

The UWI Community Film Project (UWICFP) continued to fulfil its mandate of training young, unattached inner-city youth in the rudiments of filmmaking. During the last academic year, the UWICFP trained two cohorts, graduating a total of twenty-one (21) persons. This increases the number of trained filmmakers trained by the project, since its inception in 2012, to approximately four hundred and seventy (470) persons from across Jamaica.

The Faculty of Humanities and Education also continues to maintain a strong presence in the film industry through its course and programme offerings; these cover the broad areas of digital media production, animation, film production, media management and film studies.

The Way Forward – Anticipating 2020 and beyond
$$
The academy now approaches the mid-point of the five-year strategic plan. It is imperative as we advance, in unity with the other University of the West Indies campuses, the three  strategic pillars: Access, Alignment and Agility,  that we remain focused on our vision of being an excellent global university rooted in the Caribbean,  Given the successes that have already demonstrated in the 2018/2019 academic year, the Mona Campus will continue its grounded strategic approach of mobilizing and maximizing its resources towards sustainability,  further improving the six (6) high-level priority strategies that have been adopted as the drivers of  our Campus development.  The following improvements are already underway in each of these areas: 

(1) Improving the quality of teaching, learning and student development - We will improve Teaching and Learning by approving additional staff for Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), combining the Campus Office of Online Learning (COOL) and the Medical Education Unit (MEU) to ensure that every staff member who is involved in  teaching will be exposed to valuable face to face, online and digital experience simultaneously. 

(2) Fostering a Culture of Research – The re-established Mona Office of Research and Innovation will facilitate the development of Research Clusters; assist researchers with proposal writing; identify research grant opportunities; increase the number of publications per capita; and ensure the research goals of the Strategic Plan are achieved. Faculties have also been challenged to provide Mentorship Programmes for young academics with the metric of at least two (2) mentees assigned per Faculty. To provide overall tools for the entire Campus community we will strengthen databases for all faculties, libraries, research centres, research entities, including the UWI Scholar database and the FSS Institution Research Repository.

(3) Establishing new academic/industry partnerships - In the area of Research, the Mona Office of Research and Innovation (MORI) will be empowered to improve grantsmanship, cross Campus collaborative research, and to improve quality, quantity and impact of research. We envisage that the fruits of this strategy will be realised over a two-year period.  As noted above in several areas, we are intensifying ties between the Mona Campus and the public and private sector, directly engaging the questions and problems they experience in our research agenda to produce data and analysis which will allow those entities to grow and thus appoint The UWI a major role in national and regional revitalization. 	

We fully appreciate the importance of Financial autonomy and with the knowledge gained we are working steadfastly towards improvement in our financial health status, following closely the signposted roadmap that has been identified as the best path forward. 

(4) Restoring Financial Health - Our next steps include the improvement of operations and addressing all Human Resources matters  within the Bursary;  the  Campus Finance Sub-Committee of F&GPC is charged with the rigorous analysis of all financial processes;  we plan to use  commercial  entities and business systems to turn around the current financial status; to implement systems to increase the efficacy of cost containment initiatives; and to manage risks associated with the Campus’ entrepreneurial endeavours  through the Public Private Partnerships (PPP) Unit  and  other similar initiatives. 

(5) Initiating a Caring, Accountable, Motivated Professional Team (CAMP) – At the heart of the Mona Campus operations are the people. Staff at all levels are being engaged to support their personal development and enhance operations within their entities. Accountability and professionalism are our new watchwords as we demonstrate care and motivate the best in our human resources. The next steps are to: improve HR platforms, improve operations of the Estate Management Department (EMD), and install a system of online assessment through a Staff Engagement Survey, improving both the survey content and response rate.  

(6) Digitization - Digital Transformation is key to our twenty-first century transformation and central to our improved efficiency, reliability, business continuity, resilience and revitalization. The improvement of hardware, network switches and infrastructure are urgent sites for address.   We are continuing to work with FUJITSU and other partners, from both public and private sector who are willing to invest in the digital transformation of The UWI.  To further expand and develop our teaching capacity, we will convert more courses from face-to-face to online format while improving the multimedia platform in classrooms. 

The activities over the 2018/2019 academic year that are contained within the six (6) strategic areas examined closely in this Report were also highlights of the Self-Assessment Report for the institutional accreditation of the Mona Campus. The recommendations from the Accreditation Report and Council will provide a framework for the further expansion of the strategic goals and our implementation of proposed innovation in processes in the coming years. We fully appreciate that to ensure our survival, the Mona Campus has no other choice than to maximize its intellectual, human and physical resources for a sustainable future.
