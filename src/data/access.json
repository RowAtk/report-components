                    "In 2018, we assessed the uptake of secondary education leading to tertiary education choices and found, according to the most recent census, that the Jamaican population possessing tertiary education qualifications increased from 12.3% in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.1 Over the same inter-censal period, the Jamaican population aged 15 and over gaining a secondary education, declined from 55.5% in 2001 to 52.7% in 2011. In light of a waning uptake of secondary education, and its implications for a growing under-education in this society, our current drive in the second decade of the twenty-first century to increase access to a university education is both timely and necessary for revitalizing Caribbean development. In the 2018/19 academic year our total student registration showed a 3% increase over the previous academic year. Our marketing in high schools to encourage secondary students into tertiary education stimulates the necessary expansion of both levels of education.",

The Campus in 2018/2019 registered 19,599 students, the highest number ever registered in the 71 years, providing more access than ever before. This was only possible through the efforts of the entire Mona Campus team maximizing the available resources."

                          "MSS received grant funding of approximately JMD$ 5 million through the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica (EFJ), to install a Waste Water Management System initially in two basic schools in Greater August Town - August Town Seventh Day Adventist and Hermitage Basic Schools. The Waste Water Management System involves installation of tanks for harvesting rain water, a water pump to direct grey water from the kitchen to the garden, and a solar panel to power the   water pump. The harvested rain water will be used for sanitation purposes while the grey and rain water should provide continuous water for the gardens. The implementation of a Waste Water Management System is a sustainable way of continuing the Kitchen Garden Project which was established in 2013.  In the Greater August Town Basic Schools construction and installation of this system will reduce food insecurities and boost health. This effort is linked to the second sustainable development goal - zero hunger, which aims to end hunger and malnutrition by 2030, and to ensure that everyone, especially children, have “access to sufficient and nutritious food all year round”."

While there are immediate outcomes of some research that can serve commerce or policy, some research raises the profile of the University on the global landscape, signalling our capacity for both stridency and innovative research,  and allowing where possible conversion into entrepreneurial benefits.  Partnerships are established at all levels, between staff and students, with our national and regional partners across islands, with our sister University of the West Indies campuses, and with our international connections. In building strategic partnerships in research we recognize the importance of our research integrity - the formal and informal ethics, standards, protocols and policies researchers follow in their environment, and that developing a partnership is inevitably a non-linear process involving many “starts” and “restarts”. While funding the research enterprise is an important ingredient, the spill on effect of stimulating and generating research at all levels and with strategic vibrant partnerships is unmeasurable for a university. Research is the lifeblood of our existence, running through the arteries of each discipline as they cater to the varied needs of our society and the raison d’etre of our University."

A research culture recognizes the activities and competencies that are involved in the process of research and creates opportunities to disseminate and employ research findings and solutions for the collective good. Research is not restricted to those who have earned academic stripes already, but goes through all levels of staff to graduate and undergraduate  students and to all who are aware of its centrality. A research culture encompasses the values, expectations, attitudes and norms of our research communities. It influences researchers' career paths and determines the way that research is conducted and communicated.  Diversity, both in the wide array of research that is carried out by the University and in terms of the diversity of the Campus population and its partnerships benefits everyone. The Mona Campus underscores the importance of research and in this section attests to the value we place on the research initiatives of our faculty.",

Additionally, a proposal has been written for an institutional research project to examine the Factors affecting research productivity in the FSS and FST.  The proposal has received Ethics approval and will commence in the 2019/2020 academic year.  The results of this project are expected to guide planning initiatives in the FSS as to the most effective means of increasing research output."

It is a feature of both the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Vision 2030 Jamaica National Development Plan. Understanding the fragile nature of the environment and the threat of climate change, UWI researchers sought to tackle some of the most pressing problems facing the region.  Central among these was the contribution of UWI, Mona academics to a global report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Contributors to the Special Report on Climate Change And Land were Dr. Adrian Spence of the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences, Dr. Donovan Campbell of the Department of Geography and Geology, Professor Noureddine Benkeblia of the Department of Life Sciences, and Professor Michael Taylor and Dr. Tannecia Stephenson of the Faculty of Science and Technology. The Report highlighted the effects of climate change on oceans – increase in acidity, decline in oxygen levels, rising sea levels, and ocean warming and ice–melting of permafrost. Findings of the Report were also used to inform a special Summary for Policymakers."

Each Principal shared his or her unique experiences and actions to address sustainability at their institution. The summit leaders subsequently agreed as a collective to a number of initiatives that  included exchange of faculty, staff and students, and finding indigenous responses to island issues."
