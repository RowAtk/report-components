",
                    "In 2018, we assessed the uptake of secondary education leading to tertiary education choices and found, according to the most recent census, that the Jamaican population possessing tertiary education qualifications increased from 12.3% in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.1 Over the same inter-censal period, the Jamaican population aged 15 and over gaining a secondary education, declined from 55.5% in 2001 to 52.7% in 2011. In light of a waning uptake of secondary education, and its implications for a growing under-education in this society, our current drive in the second decade of the twenty-first century to increase access to a university education is both timely and necessary for revitalizing Caribbean development. In the 2018/19 academic year our total student registration showed a 3% increase over the previous academic year. Our marketing in high schools to encourage secondary students into tertiary education stimulates the necessary expansion of both levels of education. ",
                    "Although minimal gains were experienced, we were nonetheless able to achieve a steady rise in student registration at the Mona Campus between 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The Campus in 2018/2019 registered 19,599 students, the highest number ever registered in the 71 years, providing more access than ever before. This was only possible through the efforts of the entire Mona Campus team maximizing the available resources. "
