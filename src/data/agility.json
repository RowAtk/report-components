SALISES was able to reduce spending by purchasing airline tickets directly online, reviewing and streaming existing service contracts for cost effectiveness and potential by engaging students during the summer to replace staff on leave. CARIMAC reduced hospitality costs by placing vending machines in the Main Building and Annex 2. Moving to a paperless system, they also reduced printing costs by digitizing the annual CARIMAC Times magazine and using QR Scan codes for orientation and other material. The CARIMAC Times (now CARIMAC Digitimes) and orientation material are now available electronically. CARIMAC also reduced expenditures in advertising in print media by promoting programmes and short courses by exploiting social media such as Facebook and Instagram. Social media is one of the primary ways in which information flows are now received and circulated."
