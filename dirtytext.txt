The University of the West Indies, Mona Campus’ performance during the 2018/2019 academic year was built on the foundations laid for realizing the goals of the 2017-2022 Triple A Strategic Plan. The success of the Plan rests on enabling increased Access to our educational programmes; greater Alignment and partnerships which would be beneficial to the region; and nimble Agility in responding to an ever-changing environment.As a tertiary institution of choice, we have made strides regarding the pillar of Access, in affording tertiary educational opportunities to a broad majority. Approximately 74% of undergraduates are firstgeneration university students. These students, armed with an education, have the power to change the trajectory of their families’ circumstances and to make a valuable contribution to nation-building. The returns of a good education are well-documented and include higher employment rates and compensation. It is important that The UWI continues to invest in young people. The stories of UWI students excelling in their fields are encouraging and inspiring and reflect the importance of mutuality. If we believe in and support others, they will perform to their utmost abilities.
